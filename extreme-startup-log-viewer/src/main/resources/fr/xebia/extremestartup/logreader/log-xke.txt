        <article>

            <h1>welcome to play 2.0</h1>

            <p>
                congratulations, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    your are using play 2.0.2
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>why do you see this page?</h2>

            <p>
                the <code>conf/routes</code> file defines a route that tells play to invoke the <code>application.index</code> action whenever a browser requests the / uri using the get method:
            </p>

<pre><code># home page
get     /               controllers.application.index()</code></pre>

            <p>
                so play has invoked the <code>controllers.application.index</code> method:
            </p>

<pre><code>public static result index() = {
  return ok(index.render("your new application is ready."));
}</code></pre>

            <p>
                an action method handles the incoming http request, and returns the http result to send back to the web client.
                here we send a <code>200 ok</code> response, using a template the fill it's content.
            </p>

            <p>
                the template is defined in the <code>app/views/index.scala.html</code> file and compiled as a standard java class.
            </p>

<pre><code>@(message: string)

@main("welcome to play 2.0") {

    @play20.welcome(message, style = "java")

}</code></pre>

            <p>
                the first line of the template defines the function signature. here it just takes a single <code>string</code> parameter.
                then this template calls another function defined in <code>app/views/main.scala.html</code> which displays the html layout, and another
                function that displays this welcome message. you can freely add any html fragment mixed with scala code in this file.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    <strong>note</strong> that scala is fully compatible with java, so if you don't know scala don't panic, a scala statement is very close to a java one.
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>is this your first time?</h2>

            <p>
                you can now continue with the <a href="/@documentation/javatodolist">first tutorial</a>. it will guide thru the basics of creating a play 2.0 application.
            </p>

            <h2>need to set up an ide?</h2>

            <p>
                you can start to hacking your application right now using any text editor. any changes will be automatically realoaded at the next page refresh,
                including modifications made to scala sources files.
            </p>

            <p>
                if you want to set up your application in <strong>eclipse</strong> or any other java ide, check the
                <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>

            <h2>need to connect to a database?</h2>

            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem),
                by adding these lines to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.default.driver=org.h2.driver
db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"</code></pre>

            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library
                to your application dependencies:
            </p>

<pre><code>val appdependencies = seq(
  "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.18"
)</code></pre>

            <p>
                and then add the corresponding jdbc configuration to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.url=jdbc:mysql:database_name
db.driver=org.mysql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>

            <h2>need more help?</h2>

            <p>
                when your application is run from the play console, you can access directly the current documentation at
                the <a href="/@documentation">/@documentation</a> url or go to <a href="http://www.playframework.org">http://www.playframework.org</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/play-framework">play google group</a> is where play users come to seek help, announce projects, and discuss issues and new features. if you don't have any google account, you can still join the mailing list sending an email to
                <strong>play-framework+subscribe@googlegroups.com</strong>.
            </p>

            <h1>welcome to play 2.0</h1>

            <p>
                congratulations, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    your are using play 2.0.2
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>why do you see this page?</h2>

            <p>
                the <code>conf/routes</code> file defines a route that tells play to invoke the <code>application.index</code> action whenever a browser requests the / uri using the get method:
            </p>

<pre><code># home page
get     /               controllers.application.index()</code></pre>

            <p>
                so play has invoked the <code>controllers.application.index</code> method:
            </p>

<pre><code>public static result index() = {
  return ok(index.render("your new application is ready."));
}</code></pre>

            <p>
                an action method handles the incoming http request, and returns the http result to send back to the web client.
                here we send a <code>200 ok</code> response, using a template the fill it's content.
            </p>

            <p>
                the template is defined in the <code>app/views/index.scala.html</code> file and compiled as a standard java class.
            </p>

<pre><code>@(message: string)

@main("welcome to play 2.0") {

    @play20.welcome(message, style = "java")

}</code></pre>

            <p>
                the first line of the template defines the function signature. here it just takes a single <code>string</code> parameter.
                then this template calls another function defined in <code>app/views/main.scala.html</code> which displays the html layout, and another
                function that displays this welcome message. you can freely add any html fragment mixed with scala code in this file.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    <strong>note</strong> that scala is fully compatible with java, so if you don't know scala don't panic, a scala statement is very close to a java one.
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>is this your first time?</h2>

            <p>
                you can now continue with the <a href="/@documentation/javatodolist">first tutorial</a>. it will guide thru the basics of creating a play 2.0 application.
            </p>

            <h2>need to set up an ide?</h2>

            <p>
                you can start to hacking your application right now using any text editor. any changes will be automatically realoaded at the next page refresh,
                including modifications made to scala sources files.
            </p>

            <p>
                if you want to set up your application in <strong>eclipse</strong> or any other java ide, check the
                <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>

            <h2>need to connect to a database?</h2>

            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem),
                by adding these lines to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.default.driver=org.h2.driver
db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"</code></pre>

            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library
                to your application dependencies:
            </p>

<pre><code>val appdependencies = seq(
  "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.18"
)</code></pre>

            <p>
                and then add the corresponding jdbc configuration to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.url=jdbc:mysql:database_name
db.driver=org.mysql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>

            <h2>need more help?</h2>

            <p>
                when your application is run from the play console, you can access directly the current documentation at
                the <a href="/@documentation">/@documentation</a> url or go to <a href="http://www.playframework.org">http://www.playframework.org</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/play-framework">play google group</a> is where play users come to seek help, announce projects, and discuss issues and new features. if you don't have any google account, you can still join the mailing list sending an email to
                <strong>play-framework+subscribe@googlegroups.com</strong>.

            <h2>need to connect to a database?</h2>

            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem),
                by adding these lines to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.default.driver=org.h2.driver
db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"</code></pre>

            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library
                to your application dependencies:
            </p>

<pre><code>val appdependencies = seq(
  "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.18"
)</code></pre>

            <p>
                and then add the corresponding jdbc configuration to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.url=jdbc:mysql:database_name
db.driver=org.mysql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>

            <h2>need more help?</h2>

            <h1>welcome to play 2.0</h1>

            <p>
                congratulations, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    your are using play 2.0.2
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>why do you see this page?</h2>

            <p>
                the <code>conf/routes</code> file defines a route that tells play to invoke the <code>application.index</code> action whenever a browser requests the / uri using the get method:
            </p>

<pre><code># home page
get     /               controllers.application.index()</code></pre>

            <p>
                so play has invoked the <code>controllers.application.index</code> method:
            </p>

<pre><code>public static result index() = {
  return ok(index.render("your new application is ready."));
}</code></pre>

            <p>
                an action method handles the incoming http request, and returns the http result to send back to the web client.
                here we send a <code>200 ok</code> response, using a template the fill it's content.
            </p>

            <p>
                the template is defined in the <code>app/views/index.scala.html</code> file and compiled as a standard java class.
            </p>

<pre><code>@(message: string)

@main("welcome to play 2.0") {

    @play20.welcome(message, style = "java")

}</code></pre>

            <p>
                the first line of the template defines the function signature. here it just takes a single <code>string</code> parameter.
                then this template calls another function defined in <code>app/views/main.scala.html</code> which displays the html layout, and another
                function that displays this welcome message. you can freely add any html fragment mixed with scala code in this file.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    <strong>note</strong> that scala is fully compatible with java, so if you don't know scala don't panic, a scala statement is very close to a java one.
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>is this your first time?</h2>

            <p>
                you can now continue with the <a href="/@documentation/javatodolist">first tutorial</a>. it will guide thru the basics of creating a play 2.0 application.
            </p>

            <h2>need to set up an ide?</h2>

            <p>
                you can start to hacking your application right now using any text editor. any changes will be automatically realoaded at the next page refresh,
                including modifications made to scala sources files.
            </p>

            <p>

                <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>

            <h2>need to connect to a database?</h2>

            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem),
                by adding these lines to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.default.driver=org.h2.driver
db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"</code></pre>

            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library
                to your application dependencies:
            </p>

<pre><code>val appdependencies = seq(
  "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.18"
)</code></pre>

            <p>
                and then add the corresponding jdbc configuration to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.url=jdbc:mysql:database_name
db.driver=org.mysql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>

            <h2>need more help?</h2>

            <p>
                when your application is run from the play console, you can access directly the current documentation at

        <article>

            <h1>welcome to play 2.0</h1>

            <p>
                congratulations, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    your are using play 2.0.2
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>why do you see this page?</h2>

            <p>
                the <code>conf/routes</code> file defines a route that tells play to invoke the <code>application.index</code> action whenever a browser requests the / uri using the get method:
            </p>

<pre><code># home page
get     /               controllers.application.index()</code></pre>

            <p>
                so play has invoked the <code>controllers.application.index</code> method:
            </p>

<pre><code>public static result index() = {
  return ok(index.render("your new application is ready."));
}</code></pre>

            <p>
                an action method handles the incoming http request, and returns the http result to send back to the web client.
                here we send a <code>200 ok</code> response, using a template the fill it's content.
            </p>

            <p>
                the template is defined in the <code>app/views/index.scala.html</code> file and compiled as a standard java class.
            </p>

<pre><code>@(message: string)

@main("welcome to play 2.0") {

    @play20.welcome(message, style = "java")

}</code></pre>

            <p>
                the first line of the template defines the function signature. here it just takes a single <code>string</code> parameter.
                then this template calls another function defined in <code>app/views/main.scala.html</code> which displays the html layout, and another
                function that displays this welcome message. you can freely add any html fragment mixed with scala code in this file.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    <strong>note</strong> that scala is fully compatible with java, so if you don't know scala don't panic, a scala statement is very close to a java one.
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>is this your first time?</h2>

            <p>
                you can now continue with the <a href="/@documentation/javatodolist">first tutorial</a>. it will guide thru the basics of creating a play 2.0 application.
            </p>

            <h2>need to set up an ide?</h2>

            <p>
                you can start to hacking your application right now using any text editor. any changes will be automatically realoaded at the next page refresh,
                including modifications made to scala sources files.
            </p>

            <p>
                if you want to set up your application in <strong>eclipse</strong> or any other java ide, check the
                <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>

            <h2>need to connect to a database?</h2>

            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem),
                by adding these lines to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.default.driver=org.h2.driver
db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"</code></pre>

            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library
                to your application dependencies:
            </p>

<pre><code>val appdependencies = seq(
  "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.18"
)</code></pre>

            <p>
                and then add the corresponding jdbc configuration to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.url=jdbc:mysql:database_name
db.driver=org.mysql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>

            <h2>need more help?</h2>

            <p>
                when your application is run from the play console, you can access directly the current documentation at
                the <a href="/@documentation">/@documentation</a> url or go to <a href="http://www.playframework.org">http://www.playframework.org</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/play-framework">play google group</a> is where play users come to seek help, announce projects, and discuss issues and new features. if you don't have any google account, you can still join the mailing list sending an email to
                <strong>play-framework+subscribe@googlegroups.com</strong>.
            </p>

        <article>

            <h1>welcome to play 2.0</h1>

            <p>
                congratulations, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    your are using play 2.0.2
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>why do you see this page?</h2>

            <p>
                the <code>conf/routes</code> file defines a route that tells play to invoke the <code>application.index</code> action whenever a browser requests the / uri using the get method:
            </p>

<pre><code># home page
get     /               controllers.application.index()</code></pre>

            <p>
                so play has invoked the <code>controllers.application.index</code> method:
            </p>

<pre><code>public static result index() = {
  return ok(index.render("your new application is ready."));
}</code></pre>

            <p>
                an action method handles the incoming http request, and returns the http result to send back to the web client.
                here we send a <code>200 ok</code> response, using a template the fill it's content.
            </p>

            <p>
                the template is defined in the <code>app/views/index.scala.html</code> file and compiled as a standard java class.
            </p>

<pre><code>@(message: string)

@main("welcome to play 2.0") {

    @play20.welcome(message, style = "java")

}</code></pre>

            <p>
                the first line of the template defines the function signature. here it just takes a single <code>string</code> parameter.
                then this template calls another function defined in <code>app/views/main.scala.html</code> which displays the html layout, and another
                function that displays this welcome message. you can freely add any html fragment mixed with scala code in this file.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    <strong>note</strong> that scala is fully compatible with java, so if you don't know scala don't panic, a scala statement is very close to a java one.
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>is this your first time?</h2>

            <p>
                you can now continue with the <a href="/@documentation/javatodolist">first tutorial</a>. it will guide thru the basics of creating a play 2.0 application.
            </p>

            <h2>need to set up an ide?</h2>

            <p>
                you can start to hacking your application right now using any text editor. any changes will be automatically realoaded at the next page refresh,
                including modifications made to scala sources files.
            </p>

            <p>
                if you want to set up your application in <strong>eclipse</strong> or any other java ide, check the
                <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>

            <h2>need to connect to a database?</h2>

            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem),
                by adding these lines to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.default.driver=org.h2.driver
db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"</code></pre>

            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library
                to your application dependencies:
            </p>

<pre><code>val appdependencies = seq(
  "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.18"
)</code></pre>

            <p>
                and then add the corresponding jdbc configuration to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.url=jdbc:mysql:database_name
db.driver=org.mysql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>

            <h2>need more help?</h2>

            <p>
                when your application is run from the play console, you can access directly the current documentation at
                the <a href="/@documentation">/@documentation</a> url or go to <a href="http://www.playframework.org">http://www.playframework.org</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/play-framework">play google group</a> is where play users come to seek help, announce projects, and discuss issues and new features. if you don't have any google account, you can still join the mailing list sending an email to
                <strong>play-framework+subscribe@googlegroups.com</strong>.
            </p>

            <h1>welcome to play 2.0</h1>

            <p>
                congratulations, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    your are using play 2.0.2
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>why do you see this page?</h2>

            <p>
                the <code>conf/routes</code> file defines a route that tells play to invoke the <code>application.index</code> action whenever a browser requests the / uri using the get method:
            </p>

<pre><code># home page
get     /               controllers.application.index()</code></pre>

            <p>
                so play has invoked the <code>controllers.application.index</code> method:
            </p>

<pre><code>public static result index() = {
  return ok(index.render("your new application is ready."));
}</code></pre>

            <p>
                an action method handles the incoming http request, and returns the http result to send back to the web client.
                here we send a <code>200 ok</code> response, using a template the fill it's content.
            </p>

            <p>
                the template is defined in the <code>app/views/index.scala.html</code> file and compiled as a standard java class.
            </p>

<pre><code>@(message: string)

@main("welcome to play 2.0") {

    @play20.welcome(message, style = "java")

}</code></pre>

            <p>
                the first line of the template defines the function signature. here it just takes a single <code>string</code> parameter.
                then this template calls another function defined in <code>app/views/main.scala.html</code> which displays the html layout, and another
                function that displays this welcome message. you can freely add any html fragment mixed with scala code in this file.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    <strong>note</strong> that scala is fully compatible with java, so if you don't know scala don't panic, a scala statement is very close to a java one.
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>is this your first time?</h2>

            <p>
                you can now continue with the <a href="/@documentation/javatodolist">first tutorial</a>. it will guide thru the basics of creating a play 2.0 application.
            </p>

            <h2>need to set up an ide?</h2>

            <p>
                you can start to hacking your application right now using any text editor. any changes will be automatically realoaded at the next page refresh,
                including modifications made to scala sources files.
            </p>

            <p>
                if you want to set up your application in <strong>eclipse</strong> or any other java ide, check the
                <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>

            <h2>need to connect to a database?</h2>

            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem),
                by adding these lines to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.default.driver=org.h2.driver
db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"</code></pre>

            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library
                to your application dependencies:
            </p>

<pre><code>val appdependencies = seq(
  "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.18"
)</code></pre>

            <p>
                and then add the corresponding jdbc configuration to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.url=jdbc:mysql:database_name
db.driver=org.mysql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>

            <h2>need more help?</h2>

            <p>
                when your application is run from the play console, you can access directly the current documentation at
                the <a href="/@documentation">/@documentation</a> url or go to <a href="http://www.playframework.org">http://www.playframework.org</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/play-framework">play google group</a> is where play users come to seek help, announce projects, and discuss issues and new features. if you don't have any google account, you can still join the mailing list sending an email to
                <strong>play-framework+subscribe@googlegroups.com</strong>.

            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem),
                by adding these lines to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.default.driver=org.h2.driver
db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"</code></pre>

            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library
                to your application dependencies:
            </p>

<pre><code>val appdependencies = seq(
  "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.18"
)</code></pre>

            <p>
                and then add the corresponding jdbc configuration to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.url=jdbc:mysql:database_name

        <article>

            <h1>welcome to play 2.0</h1>

            <p>
                congratulations, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    your are using play 2.0.2
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>why do you see this page?</h2>

            <p>
                the <code>conf/routes</code> file defines a route that tells play to invoke the <code>application.index</code> action whenever a browser requests the / uri using the get method:
            </p>

<pre><code># home page
get     /               controllers.application.index</code></pre>

            <p>
                so play has invoked the <code>controllers.application.index</code> method to obtain the <code>action</code> to execute:
            </p>

<pre><code>def index = action {
  ok(views.html.index("your new application is ready!"))
}</code></pre>

            <p>
                an action is a function that handles the incoming http request, and returns the http result to send back to the web client.
                here we send a <code>200 ok</code> response, using a template to fill it's content.
            </p>

            <p>
                the template is defined in the <code>app/views/index.scala.html</code> file and compiled as a scala function.
            </p>

<pre><code>@(message: string)

@main("welcome to play 2.0") {

    @play20.welcome(message)

}</code></pre>

            <p>
                the first line of the template defines the function signature. here it just takes a single <code>string</code> parameter.
                then this template calls another function defined in <code>app/views/main.scala.html</code> which displays the html layout, and another
                function that displays this welcome message. you can freely add any html fragment mixed with scala code in this file.
            </p>

            <h2>is this your first time?</h2>

            <h1>welcome to play 2.0</h1>

            <p>
                congratulations, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    your are using play 2.0.2
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>why do you see this page?</h2>

            <p>
                the <code>conf/routes</code> file defines a route that tells play to invoke the <code>application.index</code> action whenever a browser requests the / uri using the get method:
            </p>

<pre><code># home page
get     /               controllers.application.index()</code></pre>

            <p>
                so play has invoked the <code>controllers.application.index</code> method:
            </p>

<pre><code>public static result index() = {
  return ok(index.render("your new application is ready."));
}</code></pre>

            <p>
                an action method handles the incoming http request, and returns the http result to send back to the web client.
                here we send a <code>200 ok</code> response, using a template the fill it's content.
            </p>

            <p>
                the template is defined in the <code>app/views/index.scala.html</code> file and compiled as a standard java class.
            </p>

<pre><code>@(message: string)

@main("welcome to play 2.0") {

    @play20.welcome(message, style = "java")

}</code></pre>

            <p>
                the first line of the template defines the function signature. here it just takes a single <code>string</code> parameter.
                then this template calls another function defined in <code>app/views/main.scala.html</code> which displays the html layout, and another
                function that displays this welcome message. you can freely add any html fragment mixed with scala code in this file.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    <strong>note</strong> that scala is fully compatible with java, so if you don't know scala don't panic, a scala statement is very close to a java one.
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>is this your first time?</h2>

            <p>
                you can now continue with the <a href="/@documentation/javatodolist">first tutorial</a>. it will guide thru the basics of creating a play 2.0 application.
            </p>

            <h2>need to set up an ide?</h2>

            <p>
                you can start to hacking your application right now using any text editor. any changes will be automatically realoaded at the next page refresh,
                including modifications made to scala sources files.
            </p>

            <p>
                if you want to set up your application in <strong>eclipse</strong> or any other java ide, check the
                <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>

            <h2>need to connect to a database?</h2>

            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem),
                by adding these lines to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.default.driver=org.h2.driver
db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"</code></pre>

            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library
                to your application dependencies:
            </p>

<pre><code>val appdependencies = seq(
  "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.18"
)</code></pre>

            <p>
                and then add the corresponding jdbc configuration to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.url=jdbc:mysql:database_name
db.driver=org.mysql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>

            <h2>need more help?</h2>

            <p>
                when your application is run from the play console, you can access directly the current documentation at
                the <a href="/@documentation">/@documentation</a> url or go to <a href="http://www.playframework.org">http://www.playframework.org</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/play-framework">play google group</a> is where play users come to seek help, announce projects, and discuss issues and new features. if you don't have any google account, you can still join the mailing list sending an email to

        <article>

            <h1>welcome to play 2.0</h1>

            <p>
                congratulations, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    your are using play 2.0.2
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>why do you see this page?</h2>

            <p>
                the <code>conf/routes</code> file defines a route that tells play to invoke the <code>application.index</code> action whenever a browser requests the / uri using the get method:
            </p>

<pre><code># home page
get     /               controllers.application.index</code></pre>

            <p>
                so play has invoked the <code>controllers.application.index</code> method to obtain the <code>action</code> to execute:
            </p>

<pre><code>def index = action {
  ok(views.html.index("your new application is ready!"))
}</code></pre>

            <p>
                an action is a function that handles the incoming http request, and returns the http result to send back to the web client.
                here we send a <code>200 ok</code> response, using a template to fill it's content.
            </p>

            <p>
                the template is defined in the <code>app/views/index.scala.html</code> file and compiled as a scala function.
            </p>

<pre><code>@(message: string)

@main("welcome to play 2.0") {

    @play20.welcome(message)

}</code></pre>

            <p>
                the first line of the template defines the function signature. here it just takes a single <code>string</code> parameter.
                then this template calls another function defined in <code>app/views/main.scala.html</code> which displays the html layout, and another
                function that displays this welcome message. you can freely add any html fragment mixed with scala code in this file.
            </p>

            <h2>is this your first time?</h2>

            <p>
                you can now continue with the <a href="/@documentation/scalatodolist">first tutorial</a>. it will guide thru the basics of creating a play 2.0 application.
            </p>

            <h2>need to set up an ide?</h2>

            <p>
                you can start hacking your application right now using any text editor. your changes will be automatically realoaded at each page refresh,
                including modifications made to scala source files.
            </p>

            <p>
                if you want to set up your application in <strong>eclipse</strong> or any other scala ide, check the
                <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>

            <h2>need to connect to a database?</h2>

            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem),
                by adding these lines to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.default.driver=org.h2.driver
db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"</code></pre>

            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library
                to your application dependencies:
            </p>

<pre><code>val appdependencies = seq(
  "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.18"
)</code></pre>

            <p>
                and then add the corresponding jdbc configuration to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.url=jdbc:mysql:database_name
db.driver=org.mysql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>

            <h2>need more help?</h2>

            <p>
                when your application is run from the play console, you can access directly the current documentation at
                the <a href="/@documentation">/@documentation</a> url or go to <a href="http://www.playframework.org">http://www.playframework.org</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/play-framework">play google group</a> is where play users come to seek help, announce projects, and discuss issues and new features. if you don't have any google account, you can still join the mailing list sending an email to
                <strong>play-framework+subscribe@googlegroups.com</strong>.
            </p>

            <h1>welcome to play 2.0</h1>

            <p>
                congratulations, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    your are using play 2.0.2
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>why do you see this page?</h2>

            <p>
                the <code>conf/routes</code> file defines a route that tells play to invoke the <code>application.index</code> action whenever a browser requests the / uri using the get method:
            </p>

<pre><code># home page
get     /               controllers.application.index</code></pre>

            <p>
                so play has invoked the <code>controllers.application.index</code> method to obtain the <code>action</code> to execute:
            </p>

<pre><code>def index = action {
  ok(views.html.index("your new application is ready!"))
}</code></pre>

            <p>
                an action is a function that handles the incoming http request, and returns the http result to send back to the web client.
                here we send a <code>200 ok</code> response, using a template to fill it's content.
            </p>

            <p>
                the template is defined in the <code>app/views/index.scala.html</code> file and compiled as a scala function.
            </p>

<pre><code>@(message: string)

@main("welcome to play 2.0") {

    @play20.welcome(message)

}</code></pre>

            <p>
                the first line of the template defines the function signature. here it just takes a single <code>string</code> parameter.
                then this template calls another function defined in <code>app/views/main.scala.html</code> which displays the html layout, and another
                function that displays this welcome message. you can freely add any html fragment mixed with scala code in this file.
            </p>

            <h2>is this your first time?</h2>

            <p>
                you can now continue with the <a href="/@documentation/scalatodolist">first tutorial</a>. it will guide thru the basics of creating a play 2.0 application.
            </p>

            <h2>need to set up an ide?</h2>

            <p>
                you can start hacking your application right now using any text editor. your changes will be automatically realoaded at each page refresh,
                including modifications made to scala source files.
            </p>

            <p>
                if you want to set up your application in <strong>eclipse</strong> or any other scala ide, check the
                <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>

            <h2>need to connect to a database?</h2>

            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem),
                by adding these lines to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.default.driver=org.h2.driver
db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"</code></pre>

            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library
                to your application dependencies:
            </p>

<pre><code>val appdependencies = seq(
  "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.18"
)</code></pre>

            <p>
                and then add the corresponding jdbc configuration to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.url=jdbc:mysql:database_name
db.driver=org.mysql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>

            <h2>need more help?</h2>

            <p>
                when your application is run from the play console, you can access directly the current documentation at
                the <a href="/@documentation">/@documentation</a> url or go to <a href="http://www.playframework.org">http://www.playframework.org</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/play-framework">play google group</a> is where play users come to seek help, announce projects, and discuss issues and new features. if you don't have any google account, you can still join the mailing list sending an email to
                <strong>play-framework+subscribe@googlegroups.com</strong>.
            </p>

            <h1>welcome to play 2.0</h1>

            <p>
                congratulations, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    your are using play 2.0.2
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>why do you see this page?</h2>

            <p>
                the <code>conf/routes</code> file defines a route that tells play to invoke the <code>application.index</code> action whenever a browser requests the / uri using the get method:
            </p>

<pre><code># home page
get     /               controllers.application.index</code></pre>

            <p>
                so play has invoked the <code>controllers.application.index</code> method to obtain the <code>action</code> to execute:
            </p>

<pre><code>def index = action {
  ok(views.html.index("your new application is ready!"))
}</code></pre>

            <p>
                an action is a function that handles the incoming http request, and returns the http result to send back to the web client.
                here we send a <code>200 ok</code> response, using a template to fill it's content.
            </p>

            <p>
                the template is defined in the <code>app/views/index.scala.html</code> file and compiled as a scala function.
            </p>

<pre><code>@(message: string)

@main("welcome to play 2.0") {

    @play20.welcome(message)

}</code></pre>

            <p>
                the first line of the template defines the function signature. here it just takes a single <code>string</code> parameter.
                then this template calls another function defined in <code>app/views/main.scala.html</code> which displays the html layout, and another
                function that displays this welcome message. you can freely add any html fragment mixed with scala code in this file.
            </p>

            <h2>is this your first time?</h2>

            <p>
                you can now continue with the <a href="/@documentation/scalatodolist">first tutorial</a>. it will guide thru the basics of creating a play 2.0 application.
            </p>

            <h2>need to set up an ide?</h2>

            <p>
                you can start hacking your application right now using any text editor. your changes will be automatically realoaded at each page refresh,
                including modifications made to scala source files.
            </p>

            <p>
                if you want to set up your application in <strong>eclipse</strong> or any other scala ide, check the
                <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>

            <h2>need to connect to a database?</h2>

            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem),
                by adding these lines to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.default.driver=org.h2.driver
db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"</code></pre>

            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library
                to your application dependencies:
            </p>

<pre><code>val appdependencies = seq(
  "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.18"
)</code></pre>

            <p>
                and then add the corresponding jdbc configuration to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.url=jdbc:mysql:database_name
db.driver=org.mysql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>

            <h2>need more help?</h2>

            <p>
                when your application is run from the play console, you can access directly the current documentation at
                the <a href="/@documentation">/@documentation</a> url or go to <a href="http://www.playframework.org">http://www.playframework.org</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/play-framework">play google group</a> is where play users come to seek help, announce projects, and discuss issues and new features. if you don't have any google account, you can still join the mailing list sending an email to
                <strong>play-framework+subscribe@googlegroups.com</strong>.

            <h1>welcome to play 2.0</h1>

            <p>
                congratulations, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    your are using play 2.0.2
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>why do you see this page?</h2>

            <p>
                the <code>conf/routes</code> file defines a route that tells play to invoke the <code>application.index</code> action whenever a browser requests the / uri using the get method:
            </p>

<pre><code># home page
get     /               controllers.application.index</code></pre>

            <p>
                so play has invoked the <code>controllers.application.index</code> method to obtain the <code>action</code> to execute:
            </p>

<pre><code>def index = action {
  ok(views.html.index("your new application is ready!"))
}</code></pre>

            <p>
                an action is a function that handles the incoming http request, and returns the http result to send back to the web client.
                here we send a <code>200 ok</code> response, using a template to fill it's content.
            </p>

            <p>
                the template is defined in the <code>app/views/index.scala.html</code> file and compiled as a scala function.
            </p>

<pre><code>@(message: string)

@main("welcome to play 2.0") {

    @play20.welcome(message)

}</code></pre>

            <p>
                the first line of the template defines the function signature. here it just takes a single <code>string</code> parameter.
                then this template calls another function defined in <code>app/views/main.scala.html</code> which displays the html layout, and another
                function that displays this welcome message. you can freely add any html fragment mixed with scala code in this file.
            </p>

            <h2>is this your first time?</h2>

            <p>
                you can now continue with the <a href="/@documentation/scalatodolist">first tutorial</a>. it will guide thru the basics of creating a play 2.0 application.
            </p>

            <h2>need to set up an ide?</h2>

            <p>
                you can start hacking your application right now using any text editor. your changes will be automatically realoaded at each page refresh,
                including modifications made to scala source files.
            </p>

            <p>

                <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>

            <h2>need to connect to a database?</h2>

            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem),
                by adding these lines to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.default.driver=org.h2.driver
db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"</code></pre>

            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library
                to your application dependencies:
            </p>

<pre><code>val appdependencies = seq(
  "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.18"
)</code></pre>

            <p>
                and then add the corresponding jdbc configuration to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.url=jdbc:mysql:database_name
db.driver=org.mysql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>

            <h2>need more help?</h2>

            <p>
                when your application is run from the play console, you can access directly the current documentation at

        <article>

            <h1>welcome to play 2.0</h1>

            <p>
                congratulations, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    your are using play 2.0.2
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>why do you see this page?</h2>

            <p>
                the <code>conf/routes</code> file defines a route that tells play to invoke the <code>application.index</code> action whenever a browser requests the / uri using the get method:
            </p>

<pre><code># home page
get     /               controllers.application.index</code></pre>

            <p>
                so play has invoked the <code>controllers.application.index</code> method to obtain the <code>action</code> to execute:
            </p>

<pre><code>def index = action {
  ok(views.html.index("your new application is ready!"))
}</code></pre>

            <p>
                an action is a function that handles the incoming http request, and returns the http result to send back to the web client.
                here we send a <code>200 ok</code> response, using a template to fill it's content.
            </p>

            <p>
                the template is defined in the <code>app/views/index.scala.html</code> file and compiled as a scala function.
            </p>

<pre><code>@(message: string)

@main("welcome to play 2.0") {

    @play20.welcome(message)

}</code></pre>

            <p>
                the first line of the template defines the function signature. here it just takes a single <code>string</code> parameter.
                then this template calls another function defined in <code>app/views/main.scala.html</code> which displays the html layout, and another
                function that displays this welcome message. you can freely add any html fragment mixed with scala code in this file.
            </p>

            <h2>is this your first time?</h2>

            <p>
                you can now continue with the <a href="/@documentation/scalatodolist">first tutorial</a>. it will guide thru the basics of creating a play 2.0 application.
            </p>

            <h2>need to set up an ide?</h2>

            <p>
                you can start hacking your application right now using any text editor. your changes will be automatically realoaded at each page refresh,
                including modifications made to scala source files.
            </p>

            <p>
                if you want to set up your application in <strong>eclipse</strong> or any other scala ide, check the
                <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>

            <h2>need to connect to a database?</h2>

            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem),
                by adding these lines to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.default.driver=org.h2.driver
db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"</code></pre>

            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library
                to your application dependencies:
            </p>

<pre><code>val appdependencies = seq(
  "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.18"
)</code></pre>

            <p>
                and then add the corresponding jdbc configuration to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.url=jdbc:mysql:database_name
db.driver=org.mysql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>

            <h2>need more help?</h2>

            <p>
                when your application is run from the play console, you can access directly the current documentation at

        <article>

            <h1>welcome to play 2.0</h1>

            <p>
                congratulations, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    your are using play 2.0.2
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>why do you see this page?</h2>

            <p>
                the <code>conf/routes</code> file defines a route that tells play to invoke the <code>application.index</code> action whenever a browser requests the / uri using the get method:
            </p>

<pre><code># home page
get     /               controllers.application.index</code></pre>

            <p>
                so play has invoked the <code>controllers.application.index</code> method to obtain the <code>action</code> to execute:
            </p>

<pre><code>def index = action {
  ok(views.html.index("your new application is ready!"))
}</code></pre>

            <p>
                an action is a function that handles the incoming http request, and returns the http result to send back to the web client.
                here we send a <code>200 ok</code> response, using a template to fill it's content.
            </p>

            <p>
                the template is defined in the <code>app/views/index.scala.html</code> file and compiled as a scala function.
            </p>

<pre><code>@(message: string)

@main("welcome to play 2.0") {

    @play20.welcome(message)

}</code></pre>

            <p>
                the first line of the template defines the function signature. here it just takes a single <code>string</code> parameter.
                then this template calls another function defined in <code>app/views/main.scala.html</code> which displays the html layout, and another
                function that displays this welcome message. you can freely add any html fragment mixed with scala code in this file.
            </p>

            <h2>is this your first time?</h2>

            <p>
                you can now continue with the <a href="/@documentation/scalatodolist">first tutorial</a>. it will guide thru the basics of creating a play 2.0 application.
            </p>

            <h2>need to set up an ide?</h2>

            <p>
                you can start hacking your application right now using any text editor. your changes will be automatically realoaded at each page refresh,
                including modifications made to scala source files.
            </p>

            <p>
                if you want to set up your application in <strong>eclipse</strong> or any other scala ide, check the
                <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>

            <h2>need to connect to a database?</h2>

            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem),
                by adding these lines to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.default.driver=org.h2.driver
db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"</code></pre>

            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library
                to your application dependencies:
            </p>

<pre><code>val appdependencies = seq(
  "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.18"
)</code></pre>

            <p>
                and then add the corresponding jdbc configuration to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.url=jdbc:mysql:database_name
db.driver=org.mysql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>

            <h2>need more help?</h2>

            <p>
                when your application is run from the play console, you can access directly the current documentation at
                the <a href="/@documentation">/@documentation</a> url or go to <a href="http://www.playframework.org">http://www.playframework.org</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/play-framework">play google group</a> is where play users come to seek help, announce projects, and discuss issues and new features. if you don't have any google account, you can still join the mailing list sending an email to
                <strong>play-framework+subscribe@googlegroups.com</strong>.

        <article>

            <h1>welcome to play 2.0</h1>

            <p>
                congratulations, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    your are using play 2.0.2
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>why do you see this page?</h2>

            <p>
                the <code>conf/routes</code> file defines a route that tells play to invoke the <code>application.index</code> action whenever a browser requests the / uri using the get method:
            </p>

<pre><code># home page
get     /               controllers.application.index</code></pre>

            <p>
                so play has invoked the <code>controllers.application.index</code> method to obtain the <code>action</code> to execute:
            </p>

<pre><code>def index = action {
  ok(views.html.index("your new application is ready!"))
}</code></pre>

            <p>
                an action is a function that handles the incoming http request, and returns the http result to send back to the web client.
                here we send a <code>200 ok</code> response, using a template to fill it's content.
            </p>

            <p>
                the template is defined in the <code>app/views/index.scala.html</code> file and compiled as a scala function.
            </p>

<pre><code>@(message: string)

@main("welcome to play 2.0") {

    @play20.welcome(message)

}</code></pre>

            <p>
                the first line of the template defines the function signature. here it just takes a single <code>string</code> parameter.
                then this template calls another function defined in <code>app/views/main.scala.html</code> which displays the html layout, and another
                function that displays this welcome message. you can freely add any html fragment mixed with scala code in this file.
            </p>

            <h2>is this your first time?</h2>

            <p>
                you can now continue with the <a href="/@documentation/scalatodolist">first tutorial</a>. it will guide thru the basics of creating a play 2.0 application.
            </p>

            <h2>need to set up an ide?</h2>

            <p>
                you can start hacking your application right now using any text editor. your changes will be automatically realoaded at each page refresh,
                including modifications made to scala source files.
            </p>

            <p>
                if you want to set up your application in <strong>eclipse</strong> or any other scala ide, check the
                <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>

            <h2>need to connect to a database?</h2>

            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem),
                by adding these lines to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.default.driver=org.h2.driver
db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"</code></pre>

            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library
                to your application dependencies:
            </p>

<pre><code>val appdependencies = seq(
  "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.18"
)</code></pre>

            <p>
                and then add the corresponding jdbc configuration to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.url=jdbc:mysql:database_name
db.driver=org.mysql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>

            <h2>need more help?</h2>

            <p>
                when your application is run from the play console, you can access directly the current documentation at
                the <a href="/@documentation">/@documentation</a> url or go to <a href="http://www.playframework.org">http://www.playframework.org</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/play-framework">play google group</a> is where play users come to seek help, announce projects, and discuss issues and new features. if you don't have any google account, you can still join the mailing list sending an email to
                <strong>play-framework+subscribe@googlegroups.com</strong>.
            </p>

            <h1>welcome to play 2.0</h1>

            <p>
                congratulations, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    your are using play 2.0.2
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>why do you see this page?</h2>

            <p>
                the <code>conf/routes</code> file defines a route that tells play to invoke the <code>application.index</code> action whenever a browser requests the / uri using the get method:
            </p>

<pre><code># home page
get     /               controllers.application.index</code></pre>

            <p>
                so play has invoked the <code>controllers.application.index</code> method to obtain the <code>action</code> to execute:
            </p>

<pre><code>def index = action {
  ok(views.html.index("your new application is ready!"))
}</code></pre>

            <p>
                an action is a function that handles the incoming http request, and returns the http result to send back to the web client.
                here we send a <code>200 ok</code> response, using a template to fill it's content.
            </p>

            <p>
                the template is defined in the <code>app/views/index.scala.html</code> file and compiled as a scala function.
            </p>

<pre><code>@(message: string)

@main("welcome to play 2.0") {

    @play20.welcome(message)

}</code></pre>

            <p>
                the first line of the template defines the function signature. here it just takes a single <code>string</code> parameter.
                then this template calls another function defined in <code>app/views/main.scala.html</code> which displays the html layout, and another
                function that displays this welcome message. you can freely add any html fragment mixed with scala code in this file.
            </p>

            <h2>is this your first time?</h2>

            <p>
                you can now continue with the <a href="/@documentation/scalatodolist">first tutorial</a>. it will guide thru the basics of creating a play 2.0 application.
            </p>

            <h2>need to set up an ide?</h2>

            <p>
                you can start hacking your application right now using any text editor. your changes will be automatically realoaded at each page refresh,
                including modifications made to scala source files.
            </p>

            <p>
                if you want to set up your application in <strong>eclipse</strong> or any other scala ide, check the
                <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>

            <h2>need to connect to a database?</h2>

            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem),
                by adding these lines to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.default.driver=org.h2.driver
db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"</code></pre>

            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library
                to your application dependencies:
            </p>

<pre><code>val appdependencies = seq(
  "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.18"
)</code></pre>

            <p>
                and then add the corresponding jdbc configuration to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.url=jdbc:mysql:database_name
db.driver=org.mysql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>

            <h2>need more help?</h2>

            <p>
                when your application is run from the play console, you can access directly the current documentation at
                the <a href="/@documentation">/@documentation</a> url or go to <a href="http://www.playframework.org">http://www.playframework.org</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/play-framework">play google group</a> is where play users come to seek help, announce projects, and discuss issues and new features. if you don't have any google account, you can still join the mailing list sending an email to

            <h1>welcome to play 2.0</h1>

            <p>
                congratulations, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    your are using play 2.0.2
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>why do you see this page?</h2>

            <p>
                the <code>conf/routes</code> file defines a route that tells play to invoke the <code>application.index</code> action whenever a browser requests the / uri using the get method:
            </p>

<pre><code># home page
get     /               controllers.application.index</code></pre>

            <p>
                so play has invoked the <code>controllers.application.index</code> method to obtain the <code>action</code> to execute:
            </p>

<pre><code>def index = action {
  ok(views.html.index("your new application is ready!"))
}</code></pre>

            <p>
                an action is a function that handles the incoming http request, and returns the http result to send back to the web client.
                here we send a <code>200 ok</code> response, using a template to fill it's content.
            </p>

            <p>
                the template is defined in the <code>app/views/index.scala.html</code> file and compiled as a scala function.
            </p>

<pre><code>@(message: string)

@main("welcome to play 2.0") {

    @play20.welcome(message)

}</code></pre>

            <p>
                the first line of the template defines the function signature. here it just takes a single <code>string</code> parameter.
                then this template calls another function defined in <code>app/views/main.scala.html</code> which displays the html layout, and another
                function that displays this welcome message. you can freely add any html fragment mixed with scala code in this file.
            </p>

            <h2>is this your first time?</h2>

            <p>
                you can now continue with the <a href="/@documentation/scalatodolist">first tutorial</a>. it will guide thru the basics of creating a play 2.0 application.
            </p>

            <h2>need to set up an ide?</h2>

            <p>
                you can start hacking your application right now using any text editor. your changes will be automatically realoaded at each page refresh,
                including modifications made to scala source files.
            </p>

            <p>
                if you want to set up your application in <strong>eclipse</strong> or any other scala ide, check the
                <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>

            <h2>need to connect to a database?</h2>

            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem),
                by adding these lines to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.default.driver=org.h2.driver
db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"</code></pre>

            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library
                to your application dependencies:
            </p>

<pre><code>val appdependencies = seq(
  "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.18"
)</code></pre>

            <p>
                and then add the corresponding jdbc configuration to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.url=jdbc:mysql:database_name
db.driver=org.mysql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>

            <h2>need more help?</h2>

            <p>
                when your application is run from the play console, you can access directly the current documentation at
                the <a href="/@documentation">/@documentation</a> url or go to <a href="http://www.playframework.org">http://www.playframework.org</a>.

            <h1>welcome to play 2.0</h1>

            <p>
                congratulations, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    your are using play 2.0.2
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>why do you see this page?</h2>

            <p>
                the <code>conf/routes</code> file defines a route that tells play to invoke the <code>application.index</code> action whenever a browser requests the / uri using the get method:
            </p>

<pre><code># home page
get     /               controllers.application.index</code></pre>

            <p>
                so play has invoked the <code>controllers.application.index</code> method to obtain the <code>action</code> to execute:
            </p>

<pre><code>def index = action {
  ok(views.html.index("your new application is ready!"))
}</code></pre>

            <p>
                an action is a function that handles the incoming http request, and returns the http result to send back to the web client.
                here we send a <code>200 ok</code> response, using a template to fill it's content.
            </p>

            <p>
                the template is defined in the <code>app/views/index.scala.html</code> file and compiled as a scala function.
            </p>

<pre><code>@(message: string)

@main("welcome to play 2.0") {

    @play20.welcome(message)

}</code></pre>

            <p>
                the first line of the template defines the function signature. here it just takes a single <code>string</code> parameter.
                then this template calls another function defined in <code>app/views/main.scala.html</code> which displays the html layout, and another
                function that displays this welcome message. you can freely add any html fragment mixed with scala code in this file.
            </p>

            <h2>is this your first time?</h2>

            <p>
                you can now continue with the <a href="/@documentation/scalatodolist">first tutorial</a>. it will guide thru the basics of creating a play 2.0 application.
            </p>

            <h2>need to set up an ide?</h2>

            <p>
                you can start hacking your application right now using any text editor. your changes will be automatically realoaded at each page refresh,
                including modifications made to scala source files.
            </p>

            <p>
                if you want to set up your application in <strong>eclipse</strong> or any other scala ide, check the
                <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>

            <h2>need to connect to a database?</h2>

            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem),
                by adding these lines to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.default.driver=org.h2.driver
db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"</code></pre>

            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library
                to your application dependencies:
            </p>

<pre><code>val appdependencies = seq(
  "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.18"
)</code></pre>

            <p>
                and then add the corresponding jdbc configuration to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.url=jdbc:mysql:database_name
db.driver=org.mysql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>

            <h2>need more help?</h2>

            <p>
                when your application is run from the play console, you can access directly the current documentation at
                the <a href="/@documentation">/@documentation</a> url or go to <a href="http://www.playframework.org">http://www.playframework.org</a>.

            <p>
                the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/play-framework">play google group</a> is where play users come to seek help, announce projects, and discuss issues and new features. if you don't have any google account, you can still join the mailing list sending an email to

            <h1>welcome to play 2.0</h1>

            <p>
                congratulations, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    your are using play 2.0.2
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>why do you see this page?</h2>

            <p>
                the <code>conf/routes</code> file defines a route that tells play to invoke the <code>application.index</code> action whenever a browser requests the / uri using the get method:
            </p>

<pre><code># home page
get     /               controllers.application.index</code></pre>

            <p>
                so play has invoked the <code>controllers.application.index</code> method to obtain the <code>action</code> to execute:
            </p>

<pre><code>def index = action {
  ok(views.html.index("your new application is ready!"))
}</code></pre>

            <p>
                an action is a function that handles the incoming http request, and returns the http result to send back to the web client.
                here we send a <code>200 ok</code> response, using a template to fill it's content.
            </p>

            <p>
                the template is defined in the <code>app/views/index.scala.html</code> file and compiled as a scala function.
            </p>

<pre><code>@(message: string)

@main("welcome to play 2.0") {

    @play20.welcome(message)

}</code></pre>

            <p>
                the first line of the template defines the function signature. here it just takes a single <code>string</code> parameter.
                then this template calls another function defined in <code>app/views/main.scala.html</code> which displays the html layout, and another
                function that displays this welcome message. you can freely add any html fragment mixed with scala code in this file.
            </p>

            <h2>is this your first time?</h2>

            <p>
                you can now continue with the <a href="/@documentation/scalatodolist">first tutorial</a>. it will guide thru the basics of creating a play 2.0 application.
            </p>

            <h2>need to set up an ide?</h2>

            <p>
                you can start hacking your application right now using any text editor. your changes will be automatically realoaded at each page refresh,
                including modifications made to scala source files.
            </p>

            <p>
                if you want to set up your application in <strong>eclipse</strong> or any other scala ide, check the
                <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>

            <h2>need to connect to a database?</h2>

            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem),
                by adding these lines to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.default.driver=org.h2.driver
db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"</code></pre>

            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library
                to your application dependencies:
            </p>

<pre><code>val appdependencies = seq(
  "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.18"
)</code></pre>

            <p>
                and then add the corresponding jdbc configuration to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.url=jdbc:mysql:database_name
db.driver=org.mysql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>

            <h2>need more help?</h2>

            <p>
                when your application is run from the play console, you can access directly the current documentation at
                the <a href="/@documentation">/@documentation</a> url or go to <a href="http://www.playframework.org">http://www.playframework.org</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/play-framework">play google group</a> is where play users come to seek help, announce projects, and discuss issues and new features. if you don't have any google account, you can still join the mailing list sending an email to
                <strong>play-framework+subscribe@googlegroups.com</strong>.

        <article>

            <h1>welcome to play 2.0</h1>

            <p>
                congratulations, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    your are using play 2.0.2
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>why do you see this page?</h2>

            <p>
                the <code>conf/routes</code> file defines a route that tells play to invoke the <code>application.index</code> action whenever a browser requests the / uri using the get method:
            </p>

<pre><code># home page
get     /               controllers.application.index</code></pre>

            <p>
                so play has invoked the <code>controllers.application.index</code> method to obtain the <code>action</code> to execute:
            </p>

<pre><code>def index = action {
  ok(views.html.index("your new application is ready!"))
}</code></pre>

            <p>
                an action is a function that handles the incoming http request, and returns the http result to send back to the web client.
                here we send a <code>200 ok</code> response, using a template to fill it's content.
            </p>

            <p>
                the template is defined in the <code>app/views/index.scala.html</code> file and compiled as a scala function.
            </p>

<pre><code>@(message: string)

@main("welcome to play 2.0") {

    @play20.welcome(message)

}</code></pre>

            <p>
                the first line of the template defines the function signature. here it just takes a single <code>string</code> parameter.
                then this template calls another function defined in <code>app/views/main.scala.html</code> which displays the html layout, and another
                function that displays this welcome message. you can freely add any html fragment mixed with scala code in this file.
            </p>

            <h2>is this your first time?</h2>

            <p>
                you can now continue with the <a href="/@documentation/scalatodolist">first tutorial</a>. it will guide thru the basics of creating a play 2.0 application.
            </p>

            <h2>need to set up an ide?</h2>

            <p>
                you can start hacking your application right now using any text editor. your changes will be automatically realoaded at each page refresh,
                including modifications made to scala source files.
            </p>

            <p>
                if you want to set up your application in <strong>eclipse</strong> or any other scala ide, check the
                <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>

            <h2>need to connect to a database?</h2>

            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem),
                by adding these lines to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.default.driver=org.h2.driver
db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"</code></pre>

            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library
                to your application dependencies:
            </p>

<pre><code>val appdependencies = seq(
  "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.18"
)</code></pre>

            <p>
                and then add the corresponding jdbc configuration to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.url=jdbc:mysql:database_name
db.driver=org.mysql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>

            <h2>need more help?</h2>

            <p>
                when your application is run from the play console, you can access directly the current documentation at
                the <a href="/@documentation">/@documentation</a> url or go to <a href="http://www.playframework.org">http://www.playframework.org</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/play-framework">play google group</a> is where play users come to seek help, announce projects, and discuss issues and new features. if you don't have any google account, you can still join the mailing list sending an email to

            <h1>welcome to play 2.0</h1>

            <p>
                congratulations, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    your are using play 2.0.2
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>why do you see this page?</h2>

            <p>
                the <code>conf/routes</code> file defines a route that tells play to invoke the <code>application.index</code> action whenever a browser requests the / uri using the get method:
            </p>

<pre><code># home page
get     /               controllers.application.index</code></pre>

            <p>
                so play has invoked the <code>controllers.application.index</code> method to obtain the <code>action</code> to execute:
            </p>

<pre><code>def index = action {
  ok(views.html.index("your new application is ready!"))
}</code></pre>

            <p>
                an action is a function that handles the incoming http request, and returns the http result to send back to the web client.
                here we send a <code>200 ok</code> response, using a template to fill it's content.
            </p>

            <p>
                the template is defined in the <code>app/views/index.scala.html</code> file and compiled as a scala function.
            </p>

<pre><code>@(message: string)

@main("welcome to play 2.0") {

    @play20.welcome(message)

}</code></pre>

            <p>
                the first line of the template defines the function signature. here it just takes a single <code>string</code> parameter.
                then this template calls another function defined in <code>app/views/main.scala.html</code> which displays the html layout, and another
                function that displays this welcome message. you can freely add any html fragment mixed with scala code in this file.
            </p>

            <h2>is this your first time?</h2>

            <p>
                you can now continue with the <a href="/@documentation/scalatodolist">first tutorial</a>. it will guide thru the basics of creating a play 2.0 application.
            </p>

            <h2>need to set up an ide?</h2>

            <p>
                you can start hacking your application right now using any text editor. your changes will be automatically realoaded at each page refresh,
                including modifications made to scala source files.
            </p>

            <p>
                if you want to set up your application in <strong>eclipse</strong> or any other scala ide, check the
                <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>

            <h2>need to connect to a database?</h2>

            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem),
                by adding these lines to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.default.driver=org.h2.driver
db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"</code></pre>

            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library
                to your application dependencies:
            </p>

<pre><code>val appdependencies = seq(
  "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.18"
)</code></pre>

            <p>
                and then add the corresponding jdbc configuration to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.url=jdbc:mysql:database_name
db.driver=org.mysql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>

            <h2>need more help?</h2>

            <p>
                when your application is run from the play console, you can access directly the current documentation at
                the <a href="/@documentation">/@documentation</a> url or go to <a href="http://www.playframework.org">http://www.playframework.org</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/play-framework">play google group</a> is where play users come to seek help, announce projects, and discuss issues and new features. if you don't have any google account, you can still join the mailing list sending an email to
                <strong>play-framework+subscribe@googlegroups.com</strong>.

        <article>

            <h1>welcome to play 2.0</h1>

            <p>
                congratulations, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    your are using play 2.0.2
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>why do you see this page?</h2>

            <p>
                the <code>conf/routes</code> file defines a route that tells play to invoke the <code>application.index</code> action whenever a browser requests the / uri using the get method:
            </p>

<pre><code># home page
get     /               controllers.application.index</code></pre>

            <p>
                so play has invoked the <code>controllers.application.index</code> method to obtain the <code>action</code> to execute:
            </p>

<pre><code>def index = action {
  ok(views.html.index("your new application is ready!"))
}</code></pre>

            <p>
                an action is a function that handles the incoming http request, and returns the http result to send back to the web client.
                here we send a <code>200 ok</code> response, using a template to fill it's content.
            </p>

            <p>
                the template is defined in the <code>app/views/index.scala.html</code> file and compiled as a scala function.
            </p>

<pre><code>@(message: string)

@main("welcome to play 2.0") {

    @play20.welcome(message)

}</code></pre>

            <p>
                the first line of the template defines the function signature. here it just takes a single <code>string</code> parameter.
                then this template calls another function defined in <code>app/views/main.scala.html</code> which displays the html layout, and another
                function that displays this welcome message. you can freely add any html fragment mixed with scala code in this file.
            </p>

            <h2>is this your first time?</h2>

            <p>
                you can now continue with the <a href="/@documentation/scalatodolist">first tutorial</a>. it will guide thru the basics of creating a play 2.0 application.
            </p>

            <h2>need to set up an ide?</h2>

            <p>
                you can start hacking your application right now using any text editor. your changes will be automatically realoaded at each page refresh,
                including modifications made to scala source files.
            </p>

            <p>
                if you want to set up your application in <strong>eclipse</strong> or any other scala ide, check the
                <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>

            <h2>need to connect to a database?</h2>

            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem),
                by adding these lines to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.default.driver=org.h2.driver
db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"</code></pre>

            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library
                to your application dependencies:
            </p>

<pre><code>val appdependencies = seq(
  "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.18"
)</code></pre>

            <p>
                and then add the corresponding jdbc configuration to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.url=jdbc:mysql:database_name
db.driver=org.mysql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>

            <h2>need more help?</h2>

            <p>
                when your application is run from the play console, you can access directly the current documentation at
                the <a href="/@documentation">/@documentation</a> url or go to <a href="http://www.playframework.org">http://www.playframework.org</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/play-framework">play google group</a> is where play users come to seek help, announce projects, and discuss issues and new features. if you don't have any google account, you can still join the mailing list sending an email to
                <strong>play-framework+subscribe@googlegroups.com</strong>.

        <article>

            <h1>welcome to play 2.0</h1>

            <p>
                congratulations, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    your are using play 2.0.2
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>why do you see this page?</h2>

            <p>
                the <code>conf/routes</code> file defines a route that tells play to invoke the <code>application.index</code> action whenever a browser requests the / uri using the get method:
            </p>

<pre><code># home page
get     /               controllers.application.index</code></pre>

            <p>
                so play has invoked the <code>controllers.application.index</code> method to obtain the <code>action</code> to execute:
            </p>

<pre><code>def index = action {
  ok(views.html.index("your new application is ready!"))
}</code></pre>

            <p>
                an action is a function that handles the incoming http request, and returns the http result to send back to the web client.
                here we send a <code>200 ok</code> response, using a template to fill it's content.
            </p>

            <p>
                the template is defined in the <code>app/views/index.scala.html</code> file and compiled as a scala function.
            </p>

<pre><code>@(message: string)

@main("welcome to play 2.0") {

    @play20.welcome(message)

}</code></pre>

            <p>
                the first line of the template defines the function signature. here it just takes a single <code>string</code> parameter.
                then this template calls another function defined in <code>app/views/main.scala.html</code> which displays the html layout, and another
                function that displays this welcome message. you can freely add any html fragment mixed with scala code in this file.
            </p>

            <h2>is this your first time?</h2>

            <p>
                you can now continue with the <a href="/@documentation/scalatodolist">first tutorial</a>. it will guide thru the basics of creating a play 2.0 application.
            </p>

            <h2>need to set up an ide?</h2>

            <p>
                you can start hacking your application right now using any text editor. your changes will be automatically realoaded at each page refresh,
                including modifications made to scala source files.
            </p>

            <p>
                if you want to set up your application in <strong>eclipse</strong> or any other scala ide, check the
                <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>

            <h2>need to connect to a database?</h2>

            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem),
                by adding these lines to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.default.driver=org.h2.driver
db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"</code></pre>

            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library
                to your application dependencies:
            </p>

<pre><code>val appdependencies = seq(
  "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.18"
)</code></pre>

            <p>
                and then add the corresponding jdbc configuration to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.url=jdbc:mysql:database_name
db.driver=org.mysql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>

            <h2>need more help?</h2>

            <p>
                when your application is run from the play console, you can access directly the current documentation at
                the <a href="/@documentation">/@documentation</a> url or go to <a href="http://www.playframework.org">http://www.playframework.org</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/play-framework">play google group</a> is where play users come to seek help, announce projects, and discuss issues and new features. if you don't have any google account, you can still join the mailing list sending an email to

            <p>
                congratulations, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    your are using play 2.0.2
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>why do you see this page?</h2>

            <p>
                the <code>conf/routes</code> file defines a route that tells play to invoke the <code>application.index</code> action whenever a browser requests the / uri using the get method:
            </p>

<pre><code># home page
get     /               controllers.application.index</code></pre>

            <p>
                so play has invoked the <code>controllers.application.index</code> method to obtain the <code>action</code> to execute:
            </p>

<pre><code>def index = action {
  ok(views.html.index("your new application is ready!"))
}</code></pre>

            <p>
                an action is a function that handles the incoming http request, and returns the http result to send back to the web client.
                here we send a <code>200 ok</code> response, using a template to fill it's content.
            </p>

            <p>
                the template is defined in the <code>app/views/index.scala.html</code> file and compiled as a scala function.
            </p>

<pre><code>@(message: string)

@main("welcome to play 2.0") {

    @play20.welcome(message)

}</code></pre>

            <p>
                the first line of the template defines the function signature. here it just takes a single <code>string</code> parameter.
                then this template calls another function defined in <code>app/views/main.scala.html</code> which displays the html layout, and another
                function that displays this welcome message. you can freely add any html fragment mixed with scala code in this file.
            </p>

            <h2>is this your first time?</h2>

            <p>
                you can now continue with the <a href="/@documentation/scalatodolist">first tutorial</a>. it will guide thru the basics of creating a play 2.0 application.
            </p>

            <h2>need to set up an ide?</h2>

            <p>
                you can start hacking your application right now using any text editor. your changes will be automatically realoaded at each page refresh,
                including modifications made to scala source files.
            </p>

            <p>
                if you want to set up your application in <strong>eclipse</strong> or any other scala ide, check the
                <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>

            <h2>need to connect to a database?</h2>

            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem),
                by adding these lines to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.default.driver=org.h2.driver
db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"</code></pre>

            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library
                to your application dependencies:
            </p>

<pre><code>val appdependencies = seq(
  "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.18"
)</code></pre>

            <p>
                and then add the corresponding jdbc configuration to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.url=jdbc:mysql:database_name
db.driver=org.mysql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>

            <h2>need more help?</h2>

            <p>
                when your application is run from the play console, you can access directly the current documentation at
                the <a href="/@documentation">/@documentation</a> url or go to <a href="http://www.playframework.org">http://www.playframework.org</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/play-framework">play google group</a> is where play users come to seek help, announce projects, and discuss issues and new features. if you don't have any google account, you can still join the mailing list sending an email to

            <h1>welcome to play 2.0</h1>

            <p>
                congratulations, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>

            <blockquote>

                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>why do you see this page?</h2>

            <p>
                the <code>conf/routes</code> file defines a route that tells play to invoke the <code>application.index</code> action whenever a browser requests the / uri using the get method:
            </p>

<pre><code># home page
get     /               controllers.application.index</code></pre>

            <p>
                so play has invoked the <code>controllers.application.index</code> method to obtain the <code>action</code> to execute:
            </p>

<pre><code>def index = action {
  ok(views.html.index("your new application is ready!"))
}</code></pre>

            <p>
                an action is a function that handles the incoming http request, and returns the http result to send back to the web client.
                here we send a <code>200 ok</code> response, using a template to fill it's content.
            </p>

            <p>
                the template is defined in the <code>app/views/index.scala.html</code> file and compiled as a scala function.
            </p>

<pre><code>@(message: string)

                the first line of the template defines the function signature. here it just takes a single <code>string</code> parameter.

        <article>

            <h1>welcome to play 2.0</h1>

            <p>
                congratulations, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    your are using play 2.0.2
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>why do you see this page?</h2>

            <p>
                the <code>conf/routes</code> file defines a route that tells play to invoke the <code>application.index</code> action whenever a browser requests the / uri using the get method:
            </p>

<pre><code># home page
get     /               controllers.application.index</code></pre>

            <p>
                so play has invoked the <code>controllers.application.index</code> method to obtain the <code>action</code> to execute:
            </p>

<pre><code>def index = action {
  ok(views.html.index("your new application is ready!"))
}</code></pre>

            <p>
                an action is a function that handles the incoming http request, and returns the http result to send back to the web client.
                here we send a <code>200 ok</code> response, using a template to fill it's content.
            </p>

            <p>
                the template is defined in the <code>app/views/index.scala.html</code> file and compiled as a scala function.
            </p>

<pre><code>@(message: string)

@main("welcome to play 2.0") {

    @play20.welcome(message)

}</code></pre>

            <p>
                the first line of the template defines the function signature. here it just takes a single <code>string</code> parameter.
                then this template calls another function defined in <code>app/views/main.scala.html</code> which displays the html layout, and another
                function that displays this welcome message. you can freely add any html fragment mixed with scala code in this file.
            </p>

            <h2>is this your first time?</h2>

            <p>
                you can now continue with the <a href="/@documentation/scalatodolist">first tutorial</a>. it will guide thru the basics of creating a play 2.0 application.
            </p>

            <h2>need to set up an ide?</h2>

            <p>
                you can start hacking your application right now using any text editor. your changes will be automatically realoaded at each page refresh,
                including modifications made to scala source files.
            </p>

            <p>
                if you want to set up your application in <strong>eclipse</strong> or any other scala ide, check the
                <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>

            <h2>need to connect to a database?</h2>

            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem),
                by adding these lines to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.default.driver=org.h2.driver
db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"</code></pre>

            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library
                to your application dependencies:
            </p>

<pre><code>val appdependencies = seq(
  "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.18"
)</code></pre>

            <p>
                and then add the corresponding jdbc configuration to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.url=jdbc:mysql:database_name
db.driver=org.mysql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>

            <h2>need more help?</h2>

            <p>
                when your application is run from the play console, you can access directly the current documentation at
                the <a href="/@documentation">/@documentation</a> url or go to <a href="http://www.playframework.org">http://www.playframework.org</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/play-framework">play google group</a> is where play users come to seek help, announce projects, and discuss issues and new features. if you don't have any google account, you can still join the mailing list sending an email to
                <strong>play-framework+subscribe@googlegroups.com</strong>.

                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library
                to your application dependencies:
            </p>

<pre><code>val appdependencies = seq(
  "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.18"
)</code></pre>

            <p>
                and then add the corresponding jdbc configuration to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.url=jdbc:mysql:database_name
db.driver=org.mysql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>

        <article>

            <h1>welcome to play 2.0</h1>

            <p>
                congratulations, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    your are using play 2.0.2
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>why do you see this page?</h2>

            <p>
                the <code>conf/routes</code> file defines a route that tells play to invoke the <code>application.index</code> action whenever a browser requests the / uri using the get method:
            </p>

<pre><code># home page
get     /               controllers.application.index</code></pre>

            <p>
                so play has invoked the <code>controllers.application.index</code> method to obtain the <code>action</code> to execute:
            </p>

<pre><code>def index = action {
  ok(views.html.index("your new application is ready!"))
}</code></pre>

            <p>
                an action is a function that handles the incoming http request, and returns the http result to send back to the web client.
                here we send a <code>200 ok</code> response, using a template to fill it's content.
            </p>

            <p>
                the template is defined in the <code>app/views/index.scala.html</code> file and compiled as a scala function.
            </p>

<pre><code>@(message: string)

@main("welcome to play 2.0") {

    @play20.welcome(message)

}</code></pre>

            <p>
                the first line of the template defines the function signature. here it just takes a single <code>string</code> parameter.
                then this template calls another function defined in <code>app/views/main.scala.html</code> which displays the html layout, and another
                function that displays this welcome message. you can freely add any html fragment mixed with scala code in this file.
            </p>

            <h2>is this your first time?</h2>

            <p>
                you can now continue with the <a href="/@documentation/scalatodolist">first tutorial</a>. it will guide thru the basics of creating a play 2.0 application.
            </p>

            <h2>need to set up an ide?</h2>

            <p>
                you can start hacking your application right now using any text editor. your changes will be automatically realoaded at each page refresh,
                including modifications made to scala source files.
            </p>

            <p>
                if you want to set up your application in <strong>eclipse</strong> or any other scala ide, check the
                <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>

            <h2>need to connect to a database?</h2>

            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem),
                by adding these lines to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.default.driver=org.h2.driver
db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"</code></pre>

            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library
                to your application dependencies:
            </p>

<pre><code>val appdependencies = seq(
  "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.18"
)</code></pre>

            <p>
                and then add the corresponding jdbc configuration to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.url=jdbc:mysql:database_name
db.driver=org.mysql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>

            <h2>need more help?</h2>

            <p>
                when your application is run from the play console, you can access directly the current documentation at
                the <a href="/@documentation">/@documentation</a> url or go to <a href="http://www.playframework.org">http://www.playframework.org</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/play-framework">play google group</a> is where play users come to seek help, announce projects, and discuss issues and new features. if you don't have any google account, you can still join the mailing list sending an email to
                <strong>play-framework+subscribe@googlegroups.com</strong>.

            <p>
                so play has invoked the <code>controllers.application.index</code> method to obtain the <code>action</code> to execute:
            </p>

<pre><code>def index = action {
  ok(views.html.index("your new application is ready!"))
}</code></pre>

            <p>
                an action is a function that handles the incoming http request, and returns the http result to send back to the web client.
                here we send a <code>200 ok</code> response, using a template to fill it's content.
            </p>

            <p>
                the template is defined in the <code>app/views/index.scala.html</code> file and compiled as a scala function.
            </p>

<pre><code>@(message: string)

@main("welcome to play 2.0") {

    @play20.welcome(message)

}</code></pre>

            <p>
                the first line of the template defines the function signature. here it just takes a single <code>string</code> parameter.
                then this template calls another function defined in <code>app/views/main.scala.html</code> which displays the html layout, and another
                function that displays this welcome message. you can freely add any html fragment mixed with scala code in this file.
            </p>

            <h2>need to connect to a database?</h2>

            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem),
                by adding these lines to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.default.driver=org.h2.driver
db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"</code></pre>

            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library
                to your application dependencies:
            </p>

<pre><code>val appdependencies = seq(
  "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.18"
)</code></pre>

            <p>
                and then add the corresponding jdbc configuration to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.url=jdbc:mysql:database_name
db.driver=org.mysql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>

            <h2>need more help?</h2>

            <p>
                when your application is run from the play console, you can access directly the current documentation at

            <h1>welcome to play 2.0</h1>

            <p>
                congratulations, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    your are using play 2.0.2
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>why do you see this page?</h2>

            <p>
                the <code>conf/routes</code> file defines a route that tells play to invoke the <code>application.index</code> action whenever a browser requests the / uri using the get method:
            </p>

<pre><code># home page
get     /               controllers.application.index</code></pre>

            <p>
                so play has invoked the <code>controllers.application.index</code> method to obtain the <code>action</code> to execute:
            </p>

<pre><code>def index = action {
  ok(views.html.index("your new application is ready!"))
}</code></pre>

            <p>
                an action is a function that handles the incoming http request, and returns the http result to send back to the web client.
                here we send a <code>200 ok</code> response, using a template to fill it's content.

            </p>

<pre><code>@(message: string)

        <article>

            <h1>welcome to play 2.0</h1>

            <p>
                congratulations, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    your are using play 2.0.2
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>why do you see this page?</h2>

            <p>
                the <code>conf/routes</code> file defines a route that tells play to invoke the <code>application.index</code> action whenever a browser requests the / uri using the get method:
            </p>

<pre><code># home page
get     /               controllers.application.index</code></pre>

            <p>
                so play has invoked the <code>controllers.application.index</code> method to obtain the <code>action</code> to execute:
            </p>

<pre><code>def index = action {
  ok(views.html.index("your new application is ready!"))
}</code></pre>

            <p>
                an action is a function that handles the incoming http request, and returns the http result to send back to the web client.
                here we send a <code>200 ok</code> response, using a template to fill it's content.
            </p>

            <p>
                the template is defined in the <code>app/views/index.scala.html</code> file and compiled as a scala function.
            </p>

<pre><code>@(message: string)

@main("welcome to play 2.0") {

    @play20.welcome(message)

}</code></pre>

            <p>
                the first line of the template defines the function signature. here it just takes a single <code>string</code> parameter.
                then this template calls another function defined in <code>app/views/main.scala.html</code> which displays the html layout, and another
                function that displays this welcome message. you can freely add any html fragment mixed with scala code in this file.
            </p>

            <h2>is this your first time?</h2>

            <p>
                you can now continue with the <a href="/@documentation/scalatodolist">first tutorial</a>. it will guide thru the basics of creating a play 2.0 application.
            </p>

            <h2>need to set up an ide?</h2>

            <p>
                you can start hacking your application right now using any text editor. your changes will be automatically realoaded at each page refresh,
                including modifications made to scala source files.
            </p>

            <p>
                if you want to set up your application in <strong>eclipse</strong> or any other scala ide, check the
                <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>

            <h2>need to connect to a database?</h2>

            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem),
                by adding these lines to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.default.driver=org.h2.driver
db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"</code></pre>

            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library
                to your application dependencies:
            </p>

<pre><code>val appdependencies = seq(
  "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.18"
)</code></pre>

            <p>
                and then add the corresponding jdbc configuration to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.url=jdbc:mysql:database_name
db.driver=org.mysql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>

            <h2>need more help?</h2>

            <p>
                when your application is run from the play console, you can access directly the current documentation at
                the <a href="/@documentation">/@documentation</a> url or go to <a href="http://www.playframework.org">http://www.playframework.org</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/play-framework">play google group</a> is where play users come to seek help, announce projects, and discuss issues and new features. if you don't have any google account, you can still join the mailing list sending an email to
                <strong>play-framework+subscribe@googlegroups.com</strong>.

            <h1>welcome to play 2.0</h1>

            <p>
                congratulations, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    your are using play 2.0.2
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>why do you see this page?</h2>

            <p>
                the <code>conf/routes</code> file defines a route that tells play to invoke the <code>application.index</code> action whenever a browser requests the / uri using the get method:
            </p>

<pre><code># home page
get     /               controllers.application.index</code></pre>

            <p>
                so play has invoked the <code>controllers.application.index</code> method to obtain the <code>action</code> to execute:
            </p>

<pre><code>def index = action {
  ok(views.html.index("your new application is ready!"))
}</code></pre>

            <p>
                an action is a function that handles the incoming http request, and returns the http result to send back to the web client.
                here we send a <code>200 ok</code> response, using a template to fill it's content.
            </p>

            <p>
                the template is defined in the <code>app/views/index.scala.html</code> file and compiled as a scala function.
            </p>

<pre><code>@(message: string)

@main("welcome to play 2.0") {

    @play20.welcome(message)

}</code></pre>

            <p>
                the first line of the template defines the function signature. here it just takes a single <code>string</code> parameter.
                then this template calls another function defined in <code>app/views/main.scala.html</code> which displays the html layout, and another
                function that displays this welcome message. you can freely add any html fragment mixed with scala code in this file.
            </p>

            <h2>is this your first time?</h2>

            <p>
                you can now continue with the <a href="/@documentation/scalatodolist">first tutorial</a>. it will guide thru the basics of creating a play 2.0 application.
            </p>

            <h2>need to set up an ide?</h2>

            <p>
                you can start hacking your application right now using any text editor. your changes will be automatically realoaded at each page refresh,
                including modifications made to scala source files.
            </p>

            <p>
                if you want to set up your application in <strong>eclipse</strong> or any other scala ide, check the
                <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>

            <h2>need to connect to a database?</h2>

            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem),
                by adding these lines to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.default.driver=org.h2.driver
db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"</code></pre>

            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library
                to your application dependencies:
            </p>

<pre><code>val appdependencies = seq(
  "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.18"
)</code></pre>

            <p>
                and then add the corresponding jdbc configuration to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.url=jdbc:mysql:database_name
db.driver=org.mysql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>

            <h2>need more help?</h2>

            <p>
                when your application is run from the play console, you can access directly the current documentation at
                the <a href="/@documentation">/@documentation</a> url or go to <a href="http://www.playframework.org">http://www.playframework.org</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/play-framework">play google group</a> is where play users come to seek help, announce projects, and discuss issues and new features. if you don't have any google account, you can still join the mailing list sending an email to
                <strong>play-framework+subscribe@googlegroups.com</strong>.

            <h2>need to connect to a database?</h2>

            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem),
                by adding these lines to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.default.driver=org.h2.driver
db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"</code></pre>

            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library
                to your application dependencies:
            </p>

<pre><code>val appdependencies = seq(
  "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.18"
)</code></pre>

            <p>
                and then add the corresponding jdbc configuration to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.url=jdbc:mysql:database_name
db.driver=org.mysql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>

            <h1>welcome to play 2.0</h1>

            <p>
                congratulations, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    your are using play 2.0.2
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>why do you see this page?</h2>

            <p>
                the <code>conf/routes</code> file defines a route that tells play to invoke the <code>application.index</code> action whenever a browser requests the / uri using the get method:
            </p>

<pre><code># home page
get     /               controllers.application.index</code></pre>

            <p>
                so play has invoked the <code>controllers.application.index</code> method to obtain the <code>action</code> to execute:
            </p>

<pre><code>def index = action {
  ok(views.html.index("your new application is ready!"))
}</code></pre>

            <p>
                an action is a function that handles the incoming http request, and returns the http result to send back to the web client.
                here we send a <code>200 ok</code> response, using a template to fill it's content.
            </p>

            <p>
                the template is defined in the <code>app/views/index.scala.html</code> file and compiled as a scala function.
            </p>

<pre><code>@(message: string)

@main("welcome to play 2.0") {

    @play20.welcome(message)

}</code></pre>

            <p>
                the first line of the template defines the function signature. here it just takes a single <code>string</code> parameter.
                then this template calls another function defined in <code>app/views/main.scala.html</code> which displays the html layout, and another
                function that displays this welcome message. you can freely add any html fragment mixed with scala code in this file.
            </p>

            <h2>is this your first time?</h2>

            <p>
                you can now continue with the <a href="/@documentation/scalatodolist">first tutorial</a>. it will guide thru the basics of creating a play 2.0 application.
            </p>

            <h2>need to set up an ide?</h2>

            <p>
                you can start hacking your application right now using any text editor. your changes will be automatically realoaded at each page refresh,
                including modifications made to scala source files.
            </p>

            <p>
                if you want to set up your application in <strong>eclipse</strong> or any other scala ide, check the
                <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>

            <h2>need to connect to a database?</h2>

            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem),
                by adding these lines to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:

<pre><code>db.default.driver=org.h2.driver

            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library
                to your application dependencies:
            </p>

        <article>

            <h1>welcome to play 2.0</h1>

            <p>
                congratulations, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    your are using play 2.0.2
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>why do you see this page?</h2>

            <p>
                the <code>conf/routes</code> file defines a route that tells play to invoke the <code>application.index</code> action whenever a browser requests the / uri using the get method:
            </p>

<pre><code># home page
get     /               controllers.application.index</code></pre>

            <p>
                so play has invoked the <code>controllers.application.index</code> method to obtain the <code>action</code> to execute:
            </p>

<pre><code>def index = action {
  ok(views.html.index("your new application is ready!"))
}</code></pre>

            <p>
                an action is a function that handles the incoming http request, and returns the http result to send back to the web client.
                here we send a <code>200 ok</code> response, using a template to fill it's content.
            </p>

            <p>
                the template is defined in the <code>app/views/index.scala.html</code> file and compiled as a scala function.
            </p>

<pre><code>@(message: string)

@main("welcome to play 2.0") {

    @play20.welcome(message)

}</code></pre>

            <p>
                the first line of the template defines the function signature. here it just takes a single <code>string</code> parameter.
                then this template calls another function defined in <code>app/views/main.scala.html</code> which displays the html layout, and another
                function that displays this welcome message. you can freely add any html fragment mixed with scala code in this file.
            </p>

            <h2>is this your first time?</h2>

            <p>
                you can now continue with the <a href="/@documentation/scalatodolist">first tutorial</a>. it will guide thru the basics of creating a play 2.0 application.
            </p>

            <h2>need to set up an ide?</h2>

            <p>
                you can start hacking your application right now using any text editor. your changes will be automatically realoaded at each page refresh,
                including modifications made to scala source files.
            </p>

            <p>
                if you want to set up your application in <strong>eclipse</strong> or any other scala ide, check the
                <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>

            <h2>need to connect to a database?</h2>

            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem),
                by adding these lines to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.default.driver=org.h2.driver
db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"</code></pre>

            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library
                to your application dependencies:
            </p>

<pre><code>val appdependencies = seq(
  "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.18"
)</code></pre>

            <p>
                and then add the corresponding jdbc configuration to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.url=jdbc:mysql:database_name
db.driver=org.mysql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>

            <h2>need more help?</h2>

            <p>
                when your application is run from the play console, you can access directly the current documentation at
                the <a href="/@documentation">/@documentation</a> url or go to <a href="http://www.playframework.org">http://www.playframework.org</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/play-framework">play google group</a> is where play users come to seek help, announce projects, and discuss issues and new features. if you don't have any google account, you can still join the mailing list sending an email to
                <strong>play-framework+subscribe@googlegroups.com</strong>.
            </p>

                congratulations, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    your are using play 2.0.2
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>why do you see this page?</h2>

            <p>
                the <code>conf/routes</code> file defines a route that tells play to invoke the <code>application.index</code> action whenever a browser requests the / uri using the get method:
            </p>

<pre><code># home page
get     /               controllers.application.index</code></pre>

            <p>
                so play has invoked the <code>controllers.application.index</code> method to obtain the <code>action</code> to execute:
            </p>

<pre><code>def index = action {
  ok(views.html.index("your new application is ready!"))
}</code></pre>

            <p>
                an action is a function that handles the incoming http request, and returns the http result to send back to the web client.
                here we send a <code>200 ok</code> response, using a template to fill it's content.
            </p>

            <p>
                the template is defined in the <code>app/views/index.scala.html</code> file and compiled as a scala function.
            </p>

<pre><code>@(message: string)

@main("welcome to play 2.0") {

    @play20.welcome(message)

}</code></pre>

            <p>
                the first line of the template defines the function signature. here it just takes a single <code>string</code> parameter.
                then this template calls another function defined in <code>app/views/main.scala.html</code> which displays the html layout, and another
                function that displays this welcome message. you can freely add any html fragment mixed with scala code in this file.
            </p>

            <h2>is this your first time?</h2>

            <p>
                you can now continue with the <a href="/@documentation/scalatodolist">first tutorial</a>. it will guide thru the basics of creating a play 2.0 application.
            </p>

            <h2>need to set up an ide?</h2>

            <p>
                you can start hacking your application right now using any text editor. your changes will be automatically realoaded at each page refresh,
                including modifications made to scala source files.
            </p>

            <p>
                if you want to set up your application in <strong>eclipse</strong> or any other scala ide, check the
                <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>

            <h2>need to connect to a database?</h2>

            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem),
                by adding these lines to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.default.driver=org.h2.driver
db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"</code></pre>

            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library
                to your application dependencies:
            </p>

<pre><code>val appdependencies = seq(
  "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.18"
)</code></pre>

            <p>
                and then add the corresponding jdbc configuration to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.url=jdbc:mysql:database_name
db.driver=org.mysql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>

            <h2>need more help?</h2>

            <p>
                when your application is run from the play console, you can access directly the current documentation at
                the <a href="/@documentation">/@documentation</a> url or go to <a href="http://www.playframework.org">http://www.playframework.org</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/play-framework">play google group</a> is where play users come to seek help, announce projects, and discuss issues and new features. if you don't have any google account, you can still join the mailing list sending an email to

            <p>
                congratulations, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>

<pre><code>def index = action {

        <article>

            <h1>welcome to play 2.0</h1>

            <p>
                congratulations, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    your are using play 2.0.2
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>why do you see this page?</h2>

            <p>
                the <code>conf/routes</code> file defines a route that tells play to invoke the <code>application.index</code> action whenever a browser requests the / uri using the get method:
            </p>

<pre><code># home page
get     /               controllers.application.index</code></pre>

            <p>
                so play has invoked the <code>controllers.application.index</code> method to obtain the <code>action</code> to execute:
            </p>

<pre><code>def index = action {
  ok(views.html.index("your new application is ready!"))
}</code></pre>

            <p>
                an action is a function that handles the incoming http request, and returns the http result to send back to the web client.
                here we send a <code>200 ok</code> response, using a template to fill it's content.
            </p>

            <p>
                the template is defined in the <code>app/views/index.scala.html</code> file and compiled as a scala function.
            </p>

<pre><code>@(message: string)

@main("welcome to play 2.0") {

    @play20.welcome(message)

}</code></pre>

            <p>
                the first line of the template defines the function signature. here it just takes a single <code>string</code> parameter.
                then this template calls another function defined in <code>app/views/main.scala.html</code> which displays the html layout, and another
                function that displays this welcome message. you can freely add any html fragment mixed with scala code in this file.
            </p>

            <h2>is this your first time?</h2>

            <p>
                you can now continue with the <a href="/@documentation/scalatodolist">first tutorial</a>. it will guide thru the basics of creating a play 2.0 application.
            </p>

            <h2>need to set up an ide?</h2>

            <p>
                you can start hacking your application right now using any text editor. your changes will be automatically realoaded at each page refresh,
                including modifications made to scala source files.
            </p>

            <p>
                if you want to set up your application in <strong>eclipse</strong> or any other scala ide, check the
                <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>

            <h2>need to connect to a database?</h2>

            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem),
                by adding these lines to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.default.driver=org.h2.driver
db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"</code></pre>

            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library
                to your application dependencies:
            </p>

<pre><code>val appdependencies = seq(
  "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.18"
)</code></pre>

            <p>
                and then add the corresponding jdbc configuration to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.url=jdbc:mysql:database_name
db.driver=org.mysql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>

            <h2>need more help?</h2>

            <p>
                when your application is run from the play console, you can access directly the current documentation at
                the <a href="/@documentation">/@documentation</a> url or go to <a href="http://www.playframework.org">http://www.playframework.org</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/play-framework">play google group</a> is where play users come to seek help, announce projects, and discuss issues and new features. if you don't have any google account, you can still join the mailing list sending an email to
                <strong>play-framework+subscribe@googlegroups.com</strong>.
            </p>

            <h1>welcome to play 2.0</h1>

            <p>
                congratulations, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    your are using play 2.0.2
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>why do you see this page?</h2>

            <p>
                the <code>conf/routes</code> file defines a route that tells play to invoke the <code>application.index</code> action whenever a browser requests the / uri using the get method:
            </p>

<pre><code># home page
get     /               controllers.application.index</code></pre>

            <p>
                so play has invoked the <code>controllers.application.index</code> method to obtain the <code>action</code> to execute:
            </p>

<pre><code>def index = action {
  ok(views.html.index("your new application is ready!"))
}</code></pre>

            <p>
                an action is a function that handles the incoming http request, and returns the http result to send back to the web client.
                here we send a <code>200 ok</code> response, using a template to fill it's content.
            </p>

            <p>
                the template is defined in the <code>app/views/index.scala.html</code> file and compiled as a scala function.
            </p>

<pre><code>@(message: string)

@main("welcome to play 2.0") {

    @play20.welcome(message)

}</code></pre>

            <p>
                the first line of the template defines the function signature. here it just takes a single <code>string</code> parameter.
                then this template calls another function defined in <code>app/views/main.scala.html</code> which displays the html layout, and another
                function that displays this welcome message. you can freely add any html fragment mixed with scala code in this file.
            </p>

            <h2>is this your first time?</h2>

            <p>
                you can now continue with the <a href="/@documentation/scalatodolist">first tutorial</a>. it will guide thru the basics of creating a play 2.0 application.
            </p>

            <h2>need to set up an ide?</h2>

            <p>
                you can start hacking your application right now using any text editor. your changes will be automatically realoaded at each page refresh,
                including modifications made to scala source files.
            </p>

            <p>
                if you want to set up your application in <strong>eclipse</strong> or any other scala ide, check the
                <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>

            <h2>need to connect to a database?</h2>

            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem),
                by adding these lines to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.default.driver=org.h2.driver
db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"</code></pre>

            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library
                to your application dependencies:
            </p>

<pre><code>val appdependencies = seq(
  "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.18"
)</code></pre>

            <p>
                and then add the corresponding jdbc configuration to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.url=jdbc:mysql:database_name
db.driver=org.mysql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>

            <h2>need more help?</h2>

            <p>
                when your application is run from the play console, you can access directly the current documentation at
                the <a href="/@documentation">/@documentation</a> url or go to <a href="http://www.playframework.org">http://www.playframework.org</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/play-framework">play google group</a> is where play users come to seek help, announce projects, and discuss issues and new features. if you don't have any google account, you can still join the mailing list sending an email to
                <strong>play-framework+subscribe@googlegroups.com</strong>.

        <article>

            <h1>welcome to play 2.0</h1>

            <p>
                congratulations, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    your are using play 2.0.2
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>why do you see this page?</h2>

            <p>
                the <code>conf/routes</code> file defines a route that tells play to invoke the <code>application.index</code> action whenever a browser requests the / uri using the get method:
            </p>

<pre><code># home page
get     /               controllers.application.index</code></pre>

            <p>
                so play has invoked the <code>controllers.application.index</code> method to obtain the <code>action</code> to execute:
            </p>

<pre><code>def index = action {
  ok(views.html.index("your new application is ready!"))
}</code></pre>

            <p>
                an action is a function that handles the incoming http request, and returns the http result to send back to the web client.
                here we send a <code>200 ok</code> response, using a template to fill it's content.
            </p>

            <p>
                the template is defined in the <code>app/views/index.scala.html</code> file and compiled as a scala function.
            </p>

<pre><code>@(message: string)

@main("welcome to play 2.0") {

    @play20.welcome(message)

}</code></pre>

            <p>
                the first line of the template defines the function signature. here it just takes a single <code>string</code> parameter.
                then this template calls another function defined in <code>app/views/main.scala.html</code> which displays the html layout, and another
                function that displays this welcome message. you can freely add any html fragment mixed with scala code in this file.
            </p>

            <h2>is this your first time?</h2>

            <p>
                you can now continue with the <a href="/@documentation/scalatodolist">first tutorial</a>. it will guide thru the basics of creating a play 2.0 application.
            </p>

            <h2>need to set up an ide?</h2>

            <p>
                you can start hacking your application right now using any text editor. your changes will be automatically realoaded at each page refresh,
                including modifications made to scala source files.
            </p>

            <p>
                if you want to set up your application in <strong>eclipse</strong> or any other scala ide, check the
                <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>

            <h2>need to connect to a database?</h2>

            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem),
                by adding these lines to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.default.driver=org.h2.driver
db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"</code></pre>

            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library
                to your application dependencies:
            </p>

<pre><code>val appdependencies = seq(
  "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.18"
)</code></pre>

            <p>
                and then add the corresponding jdbc configuration to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.url=jdbc:mysql:database_name
db.driver=org.mysql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>

            <h2>need more help?</h2>

            <p>
                when your application is run from the play console, you can access directly the current documentation at
                the <a href="/@documentation">/@documentation</a> url or go to <a href="http://www.playframework.org">http://www.playframework.org</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/play-framework">play google group</a> is where play users come to seek help, announce projects, and discuss issues and new features. if you don't have any google account, you can still join the mailing list sending an email to
                <strong>play-framework+subscribe@googlegroups.com</strong>.

        <article>

            <h1>welcome to play 2.0</h1>

            <p>
                congratulations, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    your are using play 2.0.2
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>why do you see this page?</h2>

            <p>
                the <code>conf/routes</code> file defines a route that tells play to invoke the <code>application.index</code> action whenever a browser requests the / uri using the get method:
            </p>

<pre><code># home page
get     /               controllers.application.index</code></pre>

            <p>
                so play has invoked the <code>controllers.application.index</code> method to obtain the <code>action</code> to execute:
            </p>

<pre><code>def index = action {
  ok(views.html.index("your new application is ready!"))
}</code></pre>

            <p>
                an action is a function that handles the incoming http request, and returns the http result to send back to the web client.
                here we send a <code>200 ok</code> response, using a template to fill it's content.
            </p>

            <p>
                the template is defined in the <code>app/views/index.scala.html</code> file and compiled as a scala function.
            </p>

<pre><code>@(message: string)

@main("welcome to play 2.0") {

    @play20.welcome(message)

}</code></pre>

            <p>
                the first line of the template defines the function signature. here it just takes a single <code>string</code> parameter.
                then this template calls another function defined in <code>app/views/main.scala.html</code> which displays the html layout, and another
                function that displays this welcome message. you can freely add any html fragment mixed with scala code in this file.
            </p>

            <h2>is this your first time?</h2>

            <p>
                you can now continue with the <a href="/@documentation/scalatodolist">first tutorial</a>. it will guide thru the basics of creating a play 2.0 application.
            </p>

            <h2>need to set up an ide?</h2>

            <p>
                you can start hacking your application right now using any text editor. your changes will be automatically realoaded at each page refresh,
                including modifications made to scala source files.
            </p>

            <p>
                if you want to set up your application in <strong>eclipse</strong> or any other scala ide, check the
                <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>

            <h2>need to connect to a database?</h2>

            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem),
                by adding these lines to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.default.driver=org.h2.driver
db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"</code></pre>

            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library
                to your application dependencies:
            </p>

<pre><code>val appdependencies = seq(
  "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.18"
)</code></pre>

            <p>
                and then add the corresponding jdbc configuration to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.url=jdbc:mysql:database_name
db.driver=org.mysql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>

            <h2>need more help?</h2>

            <p>
                when your application is run from the play console, you can access directly the current documentation at
                the <a href="/@documentation">/@documentation</a> url or go to <a href="http://www.playframework.org">http://www.playframework.org</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/play-framework">play google group</a> is where play users come to seek help, announce projects, and discuss issues and new features. if you don't have any google account, you can still join the mailing list sending an email to
                <strong>play-framework+subscribe@googlegroups.com</strong>.

            <h1>welcome to play 2.0</h1>

            <p>
                congratulations, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    your are using play 2.0.2
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>why do you see this page?</h2>

            <p>
                the <code>conf/routes</code> file defines a route that tells play to invoke the <code>application.index</code> action whenever a browser requests the / uri using the get method:
            </p>

<pre><code># home page
get     /               controllers.application.index</code></pre>

            <p>
                so play has invoked the <code>controllers.application.index</code> method to obtain the <code>action</code> to execute:
            </p>

<pre><code>def index = action {
  ok(views.html.index("your new application is ready!"))
}</code></pre>

            <p>
                an action is a function that handles the incoming http request, and returns the http result to send back to the web client.
                here we send a <code>200 ok</code> response, using a template to fill it's content.
            </p>

            <p>
                the template is defined in the <code>app/views/index.scala.html</code> file and compiled as a scala function.
            </p>

<pre><code>@(message: string)

@main("welcome to play 2.0") {

    @play20.welcome(message)

}</code></pre>

            <p>
                the first line of the template defines the function signature. here it just takes a single <code>string</code> parameter.
                then this template calls another function defined in <code>app/views/main.scala.html</code> which displays the html layout, and another
                function that displays this welcome message. you can freely add any html fragment mixed with scala code in this file.
            </p>

            <h2>is this your first time?</h2>

            <p>
                you can now continue with the <a href="/@documentation/scalatodolist">first tutorial</a>. it will guide thru the basics of creating a play 2.0 application.
            </p>

            <h2>need to set up an ide?</h2>

            <p>
                you can start hacking your application right now using any text editor. your changes will be automatically realoaded at each page refresh,
                including modifications made to scala source files.
            </p>

            <p>
                if you want to set up your application in <strong>eclipse</strong> or any other scala ide, check the
                <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>

            <h2>need to connect to a database?</h2>

            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem),
                by adding these lines to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.default.driver=org.h2.driver
db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"</code></pre>

            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library
                to your application dependencies:
            </p>

<pre><code>val appdependencies = seq(
  "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.18"
)</code></pre>

            <p>
                and then add the corresponding jdbc configuration to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.url=jdbc:mysql:database_name
db.driver=org.mysql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>

            <h2>need more help?</h2>

            <p>
                when your application is run from the play console, you can access directly the current documentation at
                the <a href="/@documentation">/@documentation</a> url or go to <a href="http://www.playframework.org">http://www.playframework.org</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/play-framework">play google group</a> is where play users come to seek help, announce projects, and discuss issues and new features. if you don't have any google account, you can still join the mailing list sending an email to
                <strong>play-framework+subscribe@googlegroups.com</strong>.

        <article>

            <h1>welcome to play 2.0</h1>

            <p>
                congratulations, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    your are using play 2.0.2
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>why do you see this page?</h2>

            <p>
                the <code>conf/routes</code> file defines a route that tells play to invoke the <code>application.index</code> action whenever a browser requests the / uri using the get method:
            </p>

<pre><code># home page
get     /               controllers.application.index</code></pre>

            <p>
                so play has invoked the <code>controllers.application.index</code> method to obtain the <code>action</code> to execute:
            </p>

<pre><code>def index = action {
  ok(views.html.index("your new application is ready!"))
}</code></pre>

            <p>
                an action is a function that handles the incoming http request, and returns the http result to send back to the web client.
                here we send a <code>200 ok</code> response, using a template to fill it's content.
            </p>

            <p>
                the template is defined in the <code>app/views/index.scala.html</code> file and compiled as a scala function.
            </p>

<pre><code>@(message: string)

@main("welcome to play 2.0") {

    @play20.welcome(message)

}</code></pre>

            <p>
                the first line of the template defines the function signature. here it just takes a single <code>string</code> parameter.
                then this template calls another function defined in <code>app/views/main.scala.html</code> which displays the html layout, and another
                function that displays this welcome message. you can freely add any html fragment mixed with scala code in this file.
            </p>

            <h2>is this your first time?</h2>

            <p>
                you can now continue with the <a href="/@documentation/scalatodolist">first tutorial</a>. it will guide thru the basics of creating a play 2.0 application.
            </p>

            <h2>need to set up an ide?</h2>

            <p>
                you can start hacking your application right now using any text editor. your changes will be automatically realoaded at each page refresh,
                including modifications made to scala source files.
            </p>

            <p>
                if you want to set up your application in <strong>eclipse</strong> or any other scala ide, check the
                <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>

            <h2>need to connect to a database?</h2>

            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem),
                by adding these lines to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.default.driver=org.h2.driver
db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"</code></pre>

            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library
                to your application dependencies:
            </p>

<pre><code>val appdependencies = seq(
  "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.18"
)</code></pre>

            <p>
                and then add the corresponding jdbc configuration to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.url=jdbc:mysql:database_name
db.driver=org.mysql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>

            <h2>need more help?</h2>

            <p>
                when your application is run from the play console, you can access directly the current documentation at
                the <a href="/@documentation">/@documentation</a> url or go to <a href="http://www.playframework.org">http://www.playframework.org</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/play-framework">play google group</a> is where play users come to seek help, announce projects, and discuss issues and new features. if you don't have any google account, you can still join the mailing list sending an email to
                <strong>play-framework+subscribe@googlegroups.com</strong>.
            </p>

            <h1>welcome to play 2.0</h1>

            <p>
                congratulations, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    your are using play 2.0.2
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>why do you see this page?</h2>

            <p>
                the <code>conf/routes</code> file defines a route that tells play to invoke the <code>application.index</code> action whenever a browser requests the / uri using the get method:
            </p>

<pre><code># home page
get     /               controllers.application.index</code></pre>

            <p>
                so play has invoked the <code>controllers.application.index</code> method to obtain the <code>action</code> to execute:
            </p>

<pre><code>def index = action {
  ok(views.html.index("your new application is ready!"))
}</code></pre>

            <p>
                an action is a function that handles the incoming http request, and returns the http result to send back to the web client.
                here we send a <code>200 ok</code> response, using a template to fill it's content.
            </p>

            <p>
                the template is defined in the <code>app/views/index.scala.html</code> file and compiled as a scala function.
            </p>

<pre><code>@(message: string)

@main("welcome to play 2.0") {

    @play20.welcome(message)

}</code></pre>

            <p>
                the first line of the template defines the function signature. here it just takes a single <code>string</code> parameter.
                then this template calls another function defined in <code>app/views/main.scala.html</code> which displays the html layout, and another
                function that displays this welcome message. you can freely add any html fragment mixed with scala code in this file.
            </p>

            <h2>is this your first time?</h2>

            <p>
                you can now continue with the <a href="/@documentation/scalatodolist">first tutorial</a>. it will guide thru the basics of creating a play 2.0 application.
            </p>

            <h2>need to set up an ide?</h2>

            <p>
                you can start hacking your application right now using any text editor. your changes will be automatically realoaded at each page refresh,
                including modifications made to scala source files.
            </p>

            <p>
                if you want to set up your application in <strong>eclipse</strong> or any other scala ide, check the
                <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>

            <h2>need to connect to a database?</h2>

            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem),
                by adding these lines to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.default.driver=org.h2.driver
db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"</code></pre>

            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library
                to your application dependencies:
            </p>

<pre><code>val appdependencies = seq(
  "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.18"
)</code></pre>

            <p>
                and then add the corresponding jdbc configuration to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.url=jdbc:mysql:database_name
db.driver=org.mysql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>

            <h2>need more help?</h2>

            <p>
                when your application is run from the play console, you can access directly the current documentation at
                the <a href="/@documentation">/@documentation</a> url or go to <a href="http://www.playframework.org">http://www.playframework.org</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/play-framework">play google group</a> is where play users come to seek help, announce projects, and discuss issues and new features. if you don't have any google account, you can still join the mailing list sending an email to
                <strong>play-framework+subscribe@googlegroups.com</strong>.

            <h2>need to connect to a database?</h2>

            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem),
                by adding these lines to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.default.driver=org.h2.driver
db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"</code></pre>

            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library
                to your application dependencies:
            </p>

<pre><code>val appdependencies = seq(
  "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.18"
)</code></pre>

            <p>
                and then add the corresponding jdbc configuration to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.url=jdbc:mysql:database_name
db.driver=org.mysql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>

            <h2>need more help?</h2>

            <p>
                when your application is run from the play console, you can access directly the current documentation at

            <h1>welcome to play 2.0</h1>

            <p>
                congratulations, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    your are using play 2.0.2
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>why do you see this page?</h2>

            <p>
                the <code>conf/routes</code> file defines a route that tells play to invoke the <code>application.index</code> action whenever a browser requests the / uri using the get method:
            </p>

<pre><code># home page
get     /               controllers.application.index</code></pre>

            <p>
                so play has invoked the <code>controllers.application.index</code> method to obtain the <code>action</code> to execute:
            </p>

<pre><code>def index = action {
  ok(views.html.index("your new application is ready!"))
}</code></pre>

            <p>
                an action is a function that handles the incoming http request, and returns the http result to send back to the web client.
                here we send a <code>200 ok</code> response, using a template to fill it's content.
            </p>

            <p>
                the template is defined in the <code>app/views/index.scala.html</code> file and compiled as a scala function.
            </p>

<pre><code>@(message: string)

@main("welcome to play 2.0") {

    @play20.welcome(message)

}</code></pre>

            <p>
                the first line of the template defines the function signature. here it just takes a single <code>string</code> parameter.
                then this template calls another function defined in <code>app/views/main.scala.html</code> which displays the html layout, and another
                function that displays this welcome message. you can freely add any html fragment mixed with scala code in this file.
            </p>

            <h2>is this your first time?</h2>

            <p>
                you can now continue with the <a href="/@documentation/scalatodolist">first tutorial</a>. it will guide thru the basics of creating a play 2.0 application.

            <h2>need to set up an ide?</h2>

            <p>
                you can start hacking your application right now using any text editor. your changes will be automatically realoaded at each page refresh,
                including modifications made to scala source files.
            </p>

        <article>

            <h1>welcome to play 2.0</h1>

            <p>
                congratulations, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    your are using play 2.0.2
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>why do you see this page?</h2>

            <p>
                the <code>conf/routes</code> file defines a route that tells play to invoke the <code>application.index</code> action whenever a browser requests the / uri using the get method:
            </p>

<pre><code># home page
get     /               controllers.application.index</code></pre>

            <p>
                so play has invoked the <code>controllers.application.index</code> method to obtain the <code>action</code> to execute:
            </p>

<pre><code>def index = action {
  ok(views.html.index("your new application is ready!"))
}</code></pre>

            <p>
                an action is a function that handles the incoming http request, and returns the http result to send back to the web client.
                here we send a <code>200 ok</code> response, using a template to fill it's content.
            </p>

            <p>
                the template is defined in the <code>app/views/index.scala.html</code> file and compiled as a scala function.
            </p>

<pre><code>@(message: string)

@main("welcome to play 2.0") {

    @play20.welcome(message)

}</code></pre>

            <p>
                the first line of the template defines the function signature. here it just takes a single <code>string</code> parameter.
                then this template calls another function defined in <code>app/views/main.scala.html</code> which displays the html layout, and another
                function that displays this welcome message. you can freely add any html fragment mixed with scala code in this file.
            </p>

            <h2>is this your first time?</h2>

            <p>
                you can now continue with the <a href="/@documentation/scalatodolist">first tutorial</a>. it will guide thru the basics of creating a play 2.0 application.
            </p>

            <h2>need to set up an ide?</h2>

            <p>
                you can start hacking your application right now using any text editor. your changes will be automatically realoaded at each page refresh,
                including modifications made to scala source files.
            </p>

            <p>
                if you want to set up your application in <strong>eclipse</strong> or any other scala ide, check the
                <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>

            <h2>need to connect to a database?</h2>

            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem),
                by adding these lines to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.default.driver=org.h2.driver
db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"</code></pre>

            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library
                to your application dependencies:
            </p>

<pre><code>val appdependencies = seq(
  "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.18"
)</code></pre>

            <p>
                and then add the corresponding jdbc configuration to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.url=jdbc:mysql:database_name
db.driver=org.mysql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>

            <h2>need more help?</h2>

            <p>
                when your application is run from the play console, you can access directly the current documentation at
                the <a href="/@documentation">/@documentation</a> url or go to <a href="http://www.playframework.org">http://www.playframework.org</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/play-framework">play google group</a> is where play users come to seek help, announce projects, and discuss issues and new features. if you don't have any google account, you can still join the mailing list sending an email to
                <strong>play-framework+subscribe@googlegroups.com</strong>.
            </p>

            <h1>welcome to play 2.0</h1>

            <p>
                congratulations, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    your are using play 2.0.2
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>why do you see this page?</h2>

            <p>
                the <code>conf/routes</code> file defines a route that tells play to invoke the <code>application.index</code> action whenever a browser requests the / uri using the get method:
            </p>

<pre><code># home page
get     /               controllers.application.index</code></pre>

            <p>
                so play has invoked the <code>controllers.application.index</code> method to obtain the <code>action</code> to execute:
            </p>

<pre><code>def index = action {
  ok(views.html.index("your new application is ready!"))
}</code></pre>

            <p>
                an action is a function that handles the incoming http request, and returns the http result to send back to the web client.
                here we send a <code>200 ok</code> response, using a template to fill it's content.
            </p>

            <p>
                the template is defined in the <code>app/views/index.scala.html</code> file and compiled as a scala function.
            </p>

<pre><code>@(message: string)

@main("welcome to play 2.0") {

    @play20.welcome(message)

}</code></pre>

            <p>
                the first line of the template defines the function signature. here it just takes a single <code>string</code> parameter.
                then this template calls another function defined in <code>app/views/main.scala.html</code> which displays the html layout, and another
                function that displays this welcome message. you can freely add any html fragment mixed with scala code in this file.
            </p>

            <h2>is this your first time?</h2>

            <p>
                you can now continue with the <a href="/@documentation/scalatodolist">first tutorial</a>. it will guide thru the basics of creating a play 2.0 application.
            </p>

            <h2>need to set up an ide?</h2>

            <p>
                you can start hacking your application right now using any text editor. your changes will be automatically realoaded at each page refresh,
                including modifications made to scala source files.
            </p>

            <p>
                if you want to set up your application in <strong>eclipse</strong> or any other scala ide, check the
                <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>

            <h2>need to connect to a database?</h2>

            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem),
                by adding these lines to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.default.driver=org.h2.driver
db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"</code></pre>

            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library
                to your application dependencies:
            </p>

<pre><code>val appdependencies = seq(
  "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.18"
)</code></pre>

            <p>
                and then add the corresponding jdbc configuration to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.url=jdbc:mysql:database_name
db.driver=org.mysql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>

            <h2>need more help?</h2>

            <p>
                when your application is run from the play console, you can access directly the current documentation at
                the <a href="/@documentation">/@documentation</a> url or go to <a href="http://www.playframework.org">http://www.playframework.org</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/play-framework">play google group</a> is where play users come to seek help, announce projects, and discuss issues and new features. if you don't have any google account, you can still join the mailing list sending an email to
                <strong>play-framework+subscribe@googlegroups.com</strong>.

            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem),
                by adding these lines to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.default.driver=org.h2.driver
db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"</code></pre>

            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library
                to your application dependencies:
            </p>

<pre><code>val appdependencies = seq(
  "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.18"
)</code></pre>

            <p>
                and then add the corresponding jdbc configuration to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.url=jdbc:mysql:database_name
db.driver=org.mysql.driver
db.user=root

            <h1>welcome to play 2.0</h1>

            <p>
                congratulations, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    your are using play 2.0.2
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>why do you see this page?</h2>

            <p>
                the <code>conf/routes</code> file defines a route that tells play to invoke the <code>application.index</code> action whenever a browser requests the / uri using the get method:
            </p>

<pre><code># home page
get     /               controllers.application.index</code></pre>

            <p>
                so play has invoked the <code>controllers.application.index</code> method to obtain the <code>action</code> to execute:
            </p>

<pre><code>def index = action {
  ok(views.html.index("your new application is ready!"))
}</code></pre>

            <p>
                an action is a function that handles the incoming http request, and returns the http result to send back to the web client.
                here we send a <code>200 ok</code> response, using a template to fill it's content.
            </p>

            <p>
                the template is defined in the <code>app/views/index.scala.html</code> file and compiled as a scala function.
            </p>

<pre><code>@(message: string)

@main("welcome to play 2.0") {

    @play20.welcome(message)

}</code></pre>

            <p>
                the first line of the template defines the function signature. here it just takes a single <code>string</code> parameter.
                then this template calls another function defined in <code>app/views/main.scala.html</code> which displays the html layout, and another
                function that displays this welcome message. you can freely add any html fragment mixed with scala code in this file.
            </p>

            <h2>is this your first time?</h2>

            <p>
                you can now continue with the <a href="/@documentation/scalatodolist">first tutorial</a>. it will guide thru the basics of creating a play 2.0 application.
            </p>

            <h2>need to set up an ide?</h2>

            <p>
                you can start hacking your application right now using any text editor. your changes will be automatically realoaded at each page refresh,
                including modifications made to scala source files.
            </p>

            <p>
                if you want to set up your application in <strong>eclipse</strong> or any other scala ide, check the
                <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>

            <h2>need to connect to a database?</h2>

            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem),
                by adding these lines to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:

        <article>

            <h1>welcome to play 2.0</h1>

            <p>
                congratulations, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    your are using play 2.0.2
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>why do you see this page?</h2>

            <p>
                the <code>conf/routes</code> file defines a route that tells play to invoke the <code>application.index</code> action whenever a browser requests the / uri using the get method:
            </p>

<pre><code># home page
get     /               controllers.application.index</code></pre>

            <p>
                so play has invoked the <code>controllers.application.index</code> method to obtain the <code>action</code> to execute:
            </p>

<pre><code>def index = action {
  ok(views.html.index("your new application is ready!"))
}</code></pre>

            <p>
                an action is a function that handles the incoming http request, and returns the http result to send back to the web client.
                here we send a <code>200 ok</code> response, using a template to fill it's content.
            </p>

            <p>
                the template is defined in the <code>app/views/index.scala.html</code> file and compiled as a scala function.
            </p>

<pre><code>@(message: string)

@main("welcome to play 2.0") {

    @play20.welcome(message)

}</code></pre>

            <p>
                the first line of the template defines the function signature. here it just takes a single <code>string</code> parameter.
                then this template calls another function defined in <code>app/views/main.scala.html</code> which displays the html layout, and another
                function that displays this welcome message. you can freely add any html fragment mixed with scala code in this file.
            </p>

            <h2>is this your first time?</h2>

            <p>
                you can now continue with the <a href="/@documentation/scalatodolist">first tutorial</a>. it will guide thru the basics of creating a play 2.0 application.
            </p>

            <h2>need to set up an ide?</h2>

            <p>
                you can start hacking your application right now using any text editor. your changes will be automatically realoaded at each page refresh,
                including modifications made to scala source files.
            </p>

            <p>
                if you want to set up your application in <strong>eclipse</strong> or any other scala ide, check the
                <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>

            <h2>need to connect to a database?</h2>

            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem),
                by adding these lines to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.default.driver=org.h2.driver
db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"</code></pre>

            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library
                to your application dependencies:
            </p>

<pre><code>val appdependencies = seq(
  "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.18"
)</code></pre>

            <p>
                and then add the corresponding jdbc configuration to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.url=jdbc:mysql:database_name
db.driver=org.mysql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>

            <h2>need more help?</h2>

            <p>
                when your application is run from the play console, you can access directly the current documentation at
                the <a href="/@documentation">/@documentation</a> url or go to <a href="http://www.playframework.org">http://www.playframework.org</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/play-framework">play google group</a> is where play users come to seek help, announce projects, and discuss issues and new features. if you don't have any google account, you can still join the mailing list sending an email to
                <strong>play-framework+subscribe@googlegroups.com</strong>.
            </p>

            <h1>welcome to play 2.0</h1>

            <p>
                congratulations, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    your are using play 2.0.2
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>why do you see this page?</h2>

            <p>
                the <code>conf/routes</code> file defines a route that tells play to invoke the <code>application.index</code> action whenever a browser requests the / uri using the get method:
            </p>

<pre><code># home page
get     /               controllers.application.index</code></pre>

            <p>
                so play has invoked the <code>controllers.application.index</code> method to obtain the <code>action</code> to execute:
            </p>

<pre><code>def index = action {
  ok(views.html.index("your new application is ready!"))
}</code></pre>

            <p>
                an action is a function that handles the incoming http request, and returns the http result to send back to the web client.
                here we send a <code>200 ok</code> response, using a template to fill it's content.
            </p>

            <p>
                the template is defined in the <code>app/views/index.scala.html</code> file and compiled as a scala function.
            </p>

<pre><code>@(message: string)

@main("welcome to play 2.0") {

    @play20.welcome(message)

}</code></pre>

            <p>
                the first line of the template defines the function signature. here it just takes a single <code>string</code> parameter.
                then this template calls another function defined in <code>app/views/main.scala.html</code> which displays the html layout, and another
                function that displays this welcome message. you can freely add any html fragment mixed with scala code in this file.
            </p>

            <h2>is this your first time?</h2>

            <p>
                you can now continue with the <a href="/@documentation/scalatodolist">first tutorial</a>. it will guide thru the basics of creating a play 2.0 application.
            </p>

            <h2>need to set up an ide?</h2>

            <p>
                you can start hacking your application right now using any text editor. your changes will be automatically realoaded at each page refresh,
                including modifications made to scala source files.
            </p>

            <p>
                if you want to set up your application in <strong>eclipse</strong> or any other scala ide, check the
                <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>

            <h2>need to connect to a database?</h2>

            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem),
                by adding these lines to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.default.driver=org.h2.driver
db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"</code></pre>

            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library
                to your application dependencies:
            </p>

<pre><code>val appdependencies = seq(
  "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.18"
)</code></pre>

            <p>
                and then add the corresponding jdbc configuration to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.url=jdbc:mysql:database_name
db.driver=org.mysql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>

            <h2>need more help?</h2>

            <p>
                when your application is run from the play console, you can access directly the current documentation at
                the <a href="/@documentation">/@documentation</a> url or go to <a href="http://www.playframework.org">http://www.playframework.org</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/play-framework">play google group</a> is where play users come to seek help, announce projects, and discuss issues and new features. if you don't have any google account, you can still join the mailing list sending an email to
                <strong>play-framework+subscribe@googlegroups.com</strong>.

                function that displays this welcome message. you can freely add any html fragment mixed with scala code in this file.
            </p>

            <h2>is this your first time?</h2>

            <p>
                you can now continue with the <a href="/@documentation/scalatodolist">first tutorial</a>. it will guide thru the basics of creating a play 2.0 application.
            </p>

            <h2>need to set up an ide?</h2>

            <p>
                you can start hacking your application right now using any text editor. your changes will be automatically realoaded at each page refresh,
                including modifications made to scala source files.
            </p>

            <p>
                if you want to set up your application in <strong>eclipse</strong> or any other scala ide, check the
                <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>

            <h2>need to connect to a database?</h2>

            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem),
                by adding these lines to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.default.driver=org.h2.driver
db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"</code></pre>

            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library
                to your application dependencies:
            </p>

<pre><code>val appdependencies = seq(
  "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.18"
)</code></pre>

            <p>
                and then add the corresponding jdbc configuration to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.url=jdbc:mysql:database_name
db.driver=org.mysql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>

            <h2>need more help?</h2>

            <p>
                when your application is run from the play console, you can access directly the current documentation at
                the <a href="/@documentation">/@documentation</a> url or go to <a href="http://www.playframework.org">http://www.playframework.org</a>.

        <article>

            <h1>welcome to play 2.0</h1>

            <p>
                congratulations, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    your are using play 2.0.2
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>why do you see this page?</h2>

            <p>
                the <code>conf/routes</code> file defines a route that tells play to invoke the <code>application.index</code> action whenever a browser requests the / uri using the get method:
            </p>

<pre><code># home page
get     /               controllers.application.index</code></pre>

            <p>
                so play has invoked the <code>controllers.application.index</code> method to obtain the <code>action</code> to execute:
            </p>

<pre><code>def index = action {
  ok(views.html.index("your new application is ready!"))
}</code></pre>

            <p>
                an action is a function that handles the incoming http request, and returns the http result to send back to the web client.
                here we send a <code>200 ok</code> response, using a template to fill it's content.
            </p>

            <p>
                the template is defined in the <code>app/views/index.scala.html</code> file and compiled as a scala function.
            </p>

<pre><code>@(message: string)

@main("welcome to play 2.0") {

    @play20.welcome(message)

}</code></pre>

            <p>
                the first line of the template defines the function signature. here it just takes a single <code>string</code> parameter.
                then this template calls another function defined in <code>app/views/main.scala.html</code> which displays the html layout, and another
                function that displays this welcome message. you can freely add any html fragment mixed with scala code in this file.
            </p>

            <h2>is this your first time?</h2>

            <p>
                you can now continue with the <a href="/@documentation/scalatodolist">first tutorial</a>. it will guide thru the basics of creating a play 2.0 application.
            </p>

            <h2>need to set up an ide?</h2>

            <p>
                you can start hacking your application right now using any text editor. your changes will be automatically realoaded at each page refresh,
                including modifications made to scala source files.
            </p>

            <p>
                if you want to set up your application in <strong>eclipse</strong> or any other scala ide, check the
                <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>

            <h2>need to connect to a database?</h2>

            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem),
                by adding these lines to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.default.driver=org.h2.driver
db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"</code></pre>

            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library
                to your application dependencies:
            </p>

<pre><code>val appdependencies = seq(
  "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.18"
)</code></pre>

            <p>
                and then add the corresponding jdbc configuration to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.url=jdbc:mysql:database_name
db.driver=org.mysql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>

            <h2>need more help?</h2>

            <p>
                when your application is run from the play console, you can access directly the current documentation at
                the <a href="/@documentation">/@documentation</a> url or go to <a href="http://www.playframework.org">http://www.playframework.org</a>.

        <article>

            <h1>welcome to play 2.0</h1>

            <p>
                congratulations, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    your are using play 2.0.2
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>why do you see this page?</h2>

            <p>
                the <code>conf/routes</code> file defines a route that tells play to invoke the <code>application.index</code> action whenever a browser requests the / uri using the get method:
            </p>

<pre><code># home page
get     /               controllers.application.index</code></pre>

            <p>
                so play has invoked the <code>controllers.application.index</code> method to obtain the <code>action</code> to execute:
            </p>

<pre><code>def index = action {
  ok(views.html.index("your new application is ready!"))
}</code></pre>

            <p>
                an action is a function that handles the incoming http request, and returns the http result to send back to the web client.
                here we send a <code>200 ok</code> response, using a template to fill it's content.
            </p>

            <p>
                the template is defined in the <code>app/views/index.scala.html</code> file and compiled as a scala function.
            </p>

<pre><code>@(message: string)

@main("welcome to play 2.0") {

    @play20.welcome(message)

}</code></pre>

            <p>
                the first line of the template defines the function signature. here it just takes a single <code>string</code> parameter.
                then this template calls another function defined in <code>app/views/main.scala.html</code> which displays the html layout, and another
                function that displays this welcome message. you can freely add any html fragment mixed with scala code in this file.
            </p>

            <h2>is this your first time?</h2>

            <p>
                you can now continue with the <a href="/@documentation/scalatodolist">first tutorial</a>. it will guide thru the basics of creating a play 2.0 application.
            </p>

            <h2>need to set up an ide?</h2>

            <p>
                you can start hacking your application right now using any text editor. your changes will be automatically realoaded at each page refresh,
                including modifications made to scala source files.
            </p>

            <p>
                if you want to set up your application in <strong>eclipse</strong> or any other scala ide, check the
                <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>

            <h2>need to connect to a database?</h2>

            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem),
                by adding these lines to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.default.driver=org.h2.driver
db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"</code></pre>

            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library
                to your application dependencies:
            </p>

<pre><code>val appdependencies = seq(
  "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.18"
)</code></pre>

            <p>
                and then add the corresponding jdbc configuration to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.url=jdbc:mysql:database_name
db.driver=org.mysql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>

            <h2>need more help?</h2>

            <p>
                when your application is run from the play console, you can access directly the current documentation at
                the <a href="/@documentation">/@documentation</a> url or go to <a href="http://www.playframework.org">http://www.playframework.org</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/play-framework">play google group</a> is where play users come to seek help, announce projects, and discuss issues and new features. if you don't have any google account, you can still join the mailing list sending an email to
                <strong>play-framework+subscribe@googlegroups.com</strong>.
            </p>

        <article>

            <h1>welcome to play 2.0</h1>

            <p>
                congratulations, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    your are using play 2.0.2
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>why do you see this page?</h2>

            <p>
                the <code>conf/routes</code> file defines a route that tells play to invoke the <code>application.index</code> action whenever a browser requests the / uri using the get method:
            </p>

<pre><code># home page
get     /               controllers.application.index</code></pre>

            <p>
                so play has invoked the <code>controllers.application.index</code> method to obtain the <code>action</code> to execute:
            </p>

<pre><code>def index = action {
  ok(views.html.index("your new application is ready!"))
}</code></pre>

            <p>
                an action is a function that handles the incoming http request, and returns the http result to send back to the web client.
                here we send a <code>200 ok</code> response, using a template to fill it's content.
            </p>

            <p>
                the template is defined in the <code>app/views/index.scala.html</code> file and compiled as a scala function.
            </p>

<pre><code>@(message: string)

@main("welcome to play 2.0") {

    @play20.welcome(message)

}</code></pre>

            <p>
                the first line of the template defines the function signature. here it just takes a single <code>string</code> parameter.
                then this template calls another function defined in <code>app/views/main.scala.html</code> which displays the html layout, and another
                function that displays this welcome message. you can freely add any html fragment mixed with scala code in this file.
            </p>

            <h2>is this your first time?</h2>

            <p>
                you can now continue with the <a href="/@documentation/scalatodolist">first tutorial</a>. it will guide thru the basics of creating a play 2.0 application.
            </p>

            <h2>need to set up an ide?</h2>

            <p>
                you can start hacking your application right now using any text editor. your changes will be automatically realoaded at each page refresh,
                including modifications made to scala source files.
            </p>

            <p>
                if you want to set up your application in <strong>eclipse</strong> or any other scala ide, check the
                <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>

            <h2>need to connect to a database?</h2>

            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem),
                by adding these lines to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.default.driver=org.h2.driver
db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"</code></pre>

            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library
                to your application dependencies:
            </p>

<pre><code>val appdependencies = seq(
  "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.18"
)</code></pre>

            <p>
                and then add the corresponding jdbc configuration to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.url=jdbc:mysql:database_name
db.driver=org.mysql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>

            <h2>need more help?</h2>

            <p>
                when your application is run from the play console, you can access directly the current documentation at
                the <a href="/@documentation">/@documentation</a> url or go to <a href="http://www.playframework.org">http://www.playframework.org</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/play-framework">play google group</a> is where play users come to seek help, announce projects, and discuss issues and new features. if you don't have any google account, you can still join the mailing list sending an email to
                <strong>play-framework+subscribe@googlegroups.com</strong>.
            </p>

            <h1>welcome to play 2.0</h1>

            <p>
                congratulations, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    your are using play 2.0.2
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>why do you see this page?</h2>

            <p>
                the <code>conf/routes</code> file defines a route that tells play to invoke the <code>application.index</code> action whenever a browser requests the / uri using the get method:
            </p>

<pre><code># home page
get     /               controllers.application.index</code></pre>

            <p>
                so play has invoked the <code>controllers.application.index</code> method to obtain the <code>action</code> to execute:
            </p>

<pre><code>def index = action {
  ok(views.html.index("your new application is ready!"))
}</code></pre>

            <p>
                an action is a function that handles the incoming http request, and returns the http result to send back to the web client.
                here we send a <code>200 ok</code> response, using a template to fill it's content.
            </p>

            <p>
                the template is defined in the <code>app/views/index.scala.html</code> file and compiled as a scala function.
            </p>

<pre><code>@(message: string)

@main("welcome to play 2.0") {

    @play20.welcome(message)

}</code></pre>

            <p>
                the first line of the template defines the function signature. here it just takes a single <code>string</code> parameter.
                then this template calls another function defined in <code>app/views/main.scala.html</code> which displays the html layout, and another
                function that displays this welcome message. you can freely add any html fragment mixed with scala code in this file.
            </p>

            <h2>is this your first time?</h2>

            <p>
                you can now continue with the <a href="/@documentation/scalatodolist">first tutorial</a>. it will guide thru the basics of creating a play 2.0 application.
            </p>

            <h2>need to set up an ide?</h2>

            <p>
                you can start hacking your application right now using any text editor. your changes will be automatically realoaded at each page refresh,
                including modifications made to scala source files.
            </p>

            <p>
                if you want to set up your application in <strong>eclipse</strong> or any other scala ide, check the
                <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>

            <h2>need to connect to a database?</h2>

            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem),
                by adding these lines to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.default.driver=org.h2.driver
db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"</code></pre>

            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library
                to your application dependencies:
            </p>

<pre><code>val appdependencies = seq(
  "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.18"
)</code></pre>

            <p>
                and then add the corresponding jdbc configuration to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.url=jdbc:mysql:database_name
db.driver=org.mysql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>

            <h2>need more help?</h2>

            <p>
                when your application is run from the play console, you can access directly the current documentation at
                the <a href="/@documentation">/@documentation</a> url or go to <a href="http://www.playframework.org">http://www.playframework.org</a>.

                the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/play-framework">play google group</a> is where play users come to seek help, announce projects, and discuss issues and new features. if you don't have any google account, you can still join the mailing list sending an email to

        <article>

            <h1>welcome to play 2.0</h1>

            <p>
                congratulations, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    your are using play 2.0.2
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>why do you see this page?</h2>

            <p>
                the <code>conf/routes</code> file defines a route that tells play to invoke the <code>application.index</code> action whenever a browser requests the / uri using the get method:
            </p>

<pre><code># home page
get     /               controllers.application.index</code></pre>

            <p>
                so play has invoked the <code>controllers.application.index</code> method to obtain the <code>action</code> to execute:
            </p>

<pre><code>def index = action {
  ok(views.html.index("your new application is ready!"))
}</code></pre>

            <p>
                an action is a function that handles the incoming http request, and returns the http result to send back to the web client.
                here we send a <code>200 ok</code> response, using a template to fill it's content.
            </p>

            <p>
                the template is defined in the <code>app/views/index.scala.html</code> file and compiled as a scala function.
            </p>

<pre><code>@(message: string)

@main("welcome to play 2.0") {

    @play20.welcome(message)

}</code></pre>

            <p>
                the first line of the template defines the function signature. here it just takes a single <code>string</code> parameter.
                then this template calls another function defined in <code>app/views/main.scala.html</code> which displays the html layout, and another
                function that displays this welcome message. you can freely add any html fragment mixed with scala code in this file.
            </p>

            <h2>is this your first time?</h2>

            <p>
                you can now continue with the <a href="/@documentation/scalatodolist">first tutorial</a>. it will guide thru the basics of creating a play 2.0 application.
            </p>

            <h2>need to set up an ide?</h2>

            <p>
                you can start hacking your application right now using any text editor. your changes will be automatically realoaded at each page refresh,
                including modifications made to scala source files.
            </p>

            <p>
                if you want to set up your application in <strong>eclipse</strong> or any other scala ide, check the
                <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>

            <h2>need to connect to a database?</h2>

            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem),
                by adding these lines to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.default.driver=org.h2.driver
db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"</code></pre>

            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library
                to your application dependencies:
            </p>

<pre><code>val appdependencies = seq(
  "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.18"
)</code></pre>

            <p>
                and then add the corresponding jdbc configuration to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.url=jdbc:mysql:database_name
db.driver=org.mysql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>

            <h2>need more help?</h2>

            <p>
                when your application is run from the play console, you can access directly the current documentation at
                the <a href="/@documentation">/@documentation</a> url or go to <a href="http://www.playframework.org">http://www.playframework.org</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/play-framework">play google group</a> is where play users come to seek help, announce projects, and discuss issues and new features. if you don't have any google account, you can still join the mailing list sending an email to

        <article>

            <h1>welcome to play 2.0</h1>

            <p>
                congratulations, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    your are using play 2.0.2
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>why do you see this page?</h2>

            <p>
                the <code>conf/routes</code> file defines a route that tells play to invoke the <code>application.index</code> action whenever a browser requests the / uri using the get method:
            </p>

<pre><code># home page
get     /               controllers.application.index</code></pre>

            <p>
                so play has invoked the <code>controllers.application.index</code> method to obtain the <code>action</code> to execute:
            </p>

<pre><code>def index = action {
  ok(views.html.index("your new application is ready!"))
}</code></pre>

            <p>
                an action is a function that handles the incoming http request, and returns the http result to send back to the web client.
                here we send a <code>200 ok</code> response, using a template to fill it's content.
            </p>

            <p>
                the template is defined in the <code>app/views/index.scala.html</code> file and compiled as a scala function.
            </p>

<pre><code>@(message: string)

@main("welcome to play 2.0") {

    @play20.welcome(message)

}</code></pre>

            <p>
                the first line of the template defines the function signature. here it just takes a single <code>string</code> parameter.
                then this template calls another function defined in <code>app/views/main.scala.html</code> which displays the html layout, and another
                function that displays this welcome message. you can freely add any html fragment mixed with scala code in this file.
            </p>

            <h2>is this your first time?</h2>

            <p>
                you can now continue with the <a href="/@documentation/scalatodolist">first tutorial</a>. it will guide thru the basics of creating a play 2.0 application.
            </p>

            <h2>need to set up an ide?</h2>

            <p>
                you can start hacking your application right now using any text editor. your changes will be automatically realoaded at each page refresh,
                including modifications made to scala source files.
            </p>

            <p>
                if you want to set up your application in <strong>eclipse</strong> or any other scala ide, check the
                <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>

            <h2>need to connect to a database?</h2>

            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem),
                by adding these lines to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.default.driver=org.h2.driver
db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"</code></pre>

            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library
                to your application dependencies:
            </p>

<pre><code>val appdependencies = seq(
  "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.18"
)</code></pre>

            <p>
                and then add the corresponding jdbc configuration to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.url=jdbc:mysql:database_name
db.driver=org.mysql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>

            <h2>need more help?</h2>

            <p>
                when your application is run from the play console, you can access directly the current documentation at
                the <a href="/@documentation">/@documentation</a> url or go to <a href="http://www.playframework.org">http://www.playframework.org</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/play-framework">play google group</a> is where play users come to seek help, announce projects, and discuss issues and new features. if you don't have any google account, you can still join the mailing list sending an email to
                <strong>play-framework+subscribe@googlegroups.com</strong>.
            </p>

            <h1>welcome to play 2.0</h1>

            <p>
                congratulations, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    your are using play 2.0.2
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>why do you see this page?</h2>

            <p>
                the <code>conf/routes</code> file defines a route that tells play to invoke the <code>application.index</code> action whenever a browser requests the / uri using the get method:
            </p>

<pre><code># home page
get     /               controllers.application.index</code></pre>

            <p>
                so play has invoked the <code>controllers.application.index</code> method to obtain the <code>action</code> to execute:
            </p>

<pre><code>def index = action {
  ok(views.html.index("your new application is ready!"))
}</code></pre>

            <p>
                an action is a function that handles the incoming http request, and returns the http result to send back to the web client.
                here we send a <code>200 ok</code> response, using a template to fill it's content.
            </p>

            <p>
                the template is defined in the <code>app/views/index.scala.html</code> file and compiled as a scala function.
            </p>

<pre><code>@(message: string)

@main("welcome to play 2.0") {

    @play20.welcome(message)

}</code></pre>

            <p>
                the first line of the template defines the function signature. here it just takes a single <code>string</code> parameter.
                then this template calls another function defined in <code>app/views/main.scala.html</code> which displays the html layout, and another
                function that displays this welcome message. you can freely add any html fragment mixed with scala code in this file.
            </p>

            <h2>is this your first time?</h2>

            <p>
                you can now continue with the <a href="/@documentation/scalatodolist">first tutorial</a>. it will guide thru the basics of creating a play 2.0 application.
            </p>

            <h2>need to set up an ide?</h2>

            <p>
                you can start hacking your application right now using any text editor. your changes will be automatically realoaded at each page refresh,
                including modifications made to scala source files.
            </p>

            <p>
                if you want to set up your application in <strong>eclipse</strong> or any other scala ide, check the
                <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>

            <h2>need to connect to a database?</h2>

            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem),
                by adding these lines to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.default.driver=org.h2.driver
db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"</code></pre>

            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library
                to your application dependencies:
            </p>

<pre><code>val appdependencies = seq(
  "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.18"
)</code></pre>

            <p>
                and then add the corresponding jdbc configuration to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.url=jdbc:mysql:database_name
db.driver=org.mysql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>

            <h2>need more help?</h2>

            <p>
                when your application is run from the play console, you can access directly the current documentation at
                the <a href="/@documentation">/@documentation</a> url or go to <a href="http://www.playframework.org">http://www.playframework.org</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/play-framework">play google group</a> is where play users come to seek help, announce projects, and discuss issues and new features. if you don't have any google account, you can still join the mailing list sending an email to
                <strong>play-framework+subscribe@googlegroups.com</strong>.
            </p>

            <h1>welcome to play 2.0</h1>

            <p>
                congratulations, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    your are using play 2.0.2
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>why do you see this page?</h2>

            <p>
                the <code>conf/routes</code> file defines a route that tells play to invoke the <code>application.index</code> action whenever a browser requests the / uri using the get method:
            </p>

<pre><code># home page
get     /               controllers.application.index</code></pre>

            <p>
                so play has invoked the <code>controllers.application.index</code> method to obtain the <code>action</code> to execute:
            </p>

<pre><code>def index = action {
  ok(views.html.index("your new application is ready!"))
}</code></pre>

            <p>
                an action is a function that handles the incoming http request, and returns the http result to send back to the web client.
                here we send a <code>200 ok</code> response, using a template to fill it's content.
            </p>

            <p>
                the template is defined in the <code>app/views/index.scala.html</code> file and compiled as a scala function.
            </p>

<pre><code>@(message: string)

@main("welcome to play 2.0") {

    @play20.welcome(message)

}</code></pre>

            <p>
                the first line of the template defines the function signature. here it just takes a single <code>string</code> parameter.
                then this template calls another function defined in <code>app/views/main.scala.html</code> which displays the html layout, and another
                function that displays this welcome message. you can freely add any html fragment mixed with scala code in this file.
            </p>

            <h2>is this your first time?</h2>

            <p>
                you can now continue with the <a href="/@documentation/scalatodolist">first tutorial</a>. it will guide thru the basics of creating a play 2.0 application.
            </p>

            <h2>need to set up an ide?</h2>

            <p>
                you can start hacking your application right now using any text editor. your changes will be automatically realoaded at each page refresh,
                including modifications made to scala source files.
            </p>

            <p>
                if you want to set up your application in <strong>eclipse</strong> or any other scala ide, check the
                <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>

            <h2>need to connect to a database?</h2>

            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem),
                by adding these lines to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.default.driver=org.h2.driver
db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"</code></pre>

            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library
                to your application dependencies:
            </p>

<pre><code>val appdependencies = seq(
  "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.18"
)</code></pre>

            <p>
                and then add the corresponding jdbc configuration to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.url=jdbc:mysql:database_name
db.driver=org.mysql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>

            <h2>need more help?</h2>

            <p>
                when your application is run from the play console, you can access directly the current documentation at
                the <a href="/@documentation">/@documentation</a> url or go to <a href="http://www.playframework.org">http://www.playframework.org</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/play-framework">play google group</a> is where play users come to seek help, announce projects, and discuss issues and new features. if you don't have any google account, you can still join the mailing list sending an email to
                <strong>play-framework+subscribe@googlegroups.com</strong>.

            </p>

<pre><code>val appdependencies = seq(
  "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.18"
)</code></pre>

            <p>
                and then add the corresponding jdbc configuration to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.url=jdbc:mysql:database_name
db.driver=org.mysql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>

            <h2>need more help?</h2>

            <p>
                when your application is run from the play console, you can access directly the current documentation at
                the <a href="/@documentation">/@documentation</a> url or go to <a href="http://www.playframework.org">http://www.playframework.org</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/play-framework">play google group</a> is where play users come to seek help, announce projects, and discuss issues and new features. if you don't have any google account, you can still join the mailing list sending an email to

        <article>

            <h1>welcome to play 2.0</h1>

            <p>
                congratulations, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    your are using play 2.0.2
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>why do you see this page?</h2>

            <p>
                the <code>conf/routes</code> file defines a route that tells play to invoke the <code>application.index</code> action whenever a browser requests the / uri using the get method:
            </p>

<pre><code># home page
get     /               controllers.application.index</code></pre>

            <p>
                so play has invoked the <code>controllers.application.index</code> method to obtain the <code>action</code> to execute:
            </p>

<pre><code>def index = action {
  ok(views.html.index("your new application is ready!"))
}</code></pre>

            <p>
                an action is a function that handles the incoming http request, and returns the http result to send back to the web client.
                here we send a <code>200 ok</code> response, using a template to fill it's content.
            </p>

            <p>
                the template is defined in the <code>app/views/index.scala.html</code> file and compiled as a scala function.
            </p>

<pre><code>@(message: string)

@main("welcome to play 2.0") {

    @play20.welcome(message)

}</code></pre>

            <p>
                the first line of the template defines the function signature. here it just takes a single <code>string</code> parameter.
                then this template calls another function defined in <code>app/views/main.scala.html</code> which displays the html layout, and another
                function that displays this welcome message. you can freely add any html fragment mixed with scala code in this file.
            </p>

            <h2>is this your first time?</h2>

            <p>
                you can now continue with the <a href="/@documentation/scalatodolist">first tutorial</a>. it will guide thru the basics of creating a play 2.0 application.
            </p>

            <h2>need to set up an ide?</h2>

            <p>
                you can start hacking your application right now using any text editor. your changes will be automatically realoaded at each page refresh,
                including modifications made to scala source files.
            </p>

            <p>
                if you want to set up your application in <strong>eclipse</strong> or any other scala ide, check the
                <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>

            <h2>need to connect to a database?</h2>

            <h1>welcome to play 2.0</h1>

            <p>
                congratulations, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    your are using play 2.0.2
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>why do you see this page?</h2>

            <p>
                the <code>conf/routes</code> file defines a route that tells play to invoke the <code>application.index</code> action whenever a browser requests the / uri using the get method:
            </p>

<pre><code># home page
get     /               controllers.application.index</code></pre>

            <p>
                so play has invoked the <code>controllers.application.index</code> method to obtain the <code>action</code> to execute:
            </p>

<pre><code>def index = action {
  ok(views.html.index("your new application is ready!"))
}</code></pre>

            <p>
                an action is a function that handles the incoming http request, and returns the http result to send back to the web client.
                here we send a <code>200 ok</code> response, using a template to fill it's content.
            </p>

            <p>
                the template is defined in the <code>app/views/index.scala.html</code> file and compiled as a scala function.
            </p>

<pre><code>@(message: string)

@main("welcome to play 2.0") {

    @play20.welcome(message)

}</code></pre>

            <p>
                the first line of the template defines the function signature. here it just takes a single <code>string</code> parameter.
                then this template calls another function defined in <code>app/views/main.scala.html</code> which displays the html layout, and another
                function that displays this welcome message. you can freely add any html fragment mixed with scala code in this file.
            </p>

            <h2>is this your first time?</h2>

            <p>
                you can now continue with the <a href="/@documentation/scalatodolist">first tutorial</a>. it will guide thru the basics of creating a play 2.0 application.
            </p>

            <h2>need to set up an ide?</h2>

            <p>
                you can start hacking your application right now using any text editor. your changes will be automatically realoaded at each page refresh,
                including modifications made to scala source files.
            </p>

            <p>
                if you want to set up your application in <strong>eclipse</strong> or any other scala ide, check the
                <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>

            <h2>need to connect to a database?</h2>

            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem),
                by adding these lines to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.default.driver=org.h2.driver
db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"</code></pre>

            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library
                to your application dependencies:
            </p>

<pre><code>val appdependencies = seq(
  "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.18"
)</code></pre>

            <p>
                and then add the corresponding jdbc configuration to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.url=jdbc:mysql:database_name
db.driver=org.mysql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>

            <h2>need more help?</h2>

            <p>
                when your application is run from the play console, you can access directly the current documentation at

        <article>

            <h1>welcome to play 2.0</h1>

            <p>
                congratulations, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    your are using play 2.0.2
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>why do you see this page?</h2>

            <p>
                the <code>conf/routes</code> file defines a route that tells play to invoke the <code>application.index</code> action whenever a browser requests the / uri using the get method:
            </p>

<pre><code># home page
get     /               controllers.application.index</code></pre>

            <p>
                so play has invoked the <code>controllers.application.index</code> method to obtain the <code>action</code> to execute:
            </p>

<pre><code>def index = action {
  ok(views.html.index("your new application is ready!"))
}</code></pre>

            <p>
                an action is a function that handles the incoming http request, and returns the http result to send back to the web client.
                here we send a <code>200 ok</code> response, using a template to fill it's content.
            </p>

            <p>
                the template is defined in the <code>app/views/index.scala.html</code> file and compiled as a scala function.
            </p>

<pre><code>@(message: string)

@main("welcome to play 2.0") {

    @play20.welcome(message)

}</code></pre>

            <p>
                the first line of the template defines the function signature. here it just takes a single <code>string</code> parameter.
                then this template calls another function defined in <code>app/views/main.scala.html</code> which displays the html layout, and another
                function that displays this welcome message. you can freely add any html fragment mixed with scala code in this file.
            </p>

            <h2>is this your first time?</h2>

            <p>
                you can now continue with the <a href="/@documentation/scalatodolist">first tutorial</a>. it will guide thru the basics of creating a play 2.0 application.
            </p>

            <h2>need to set up an ide?</h2>

            <p>
                you can start hacking your application right now using any text editor. your changes will be automatically realoaded at each page refresh,
                including modifications made to scala source files.
            </p>

            <p>
                if you want to set up your application in <strong>eclipse</strong> or any other scala ide, check the
                <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>

            <h2>need to connect to a database?</h2>

            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem),
                by adding these lines to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.default.driver=org.h2.driver
db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"</code></pre>

            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library
                to your application dependencies:
            </p>

<pre><code>val appdependencies = seq(
  "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.18"
)</code></pre>

            <p>
                and then add the corresponding jdbc configuration to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.url=jdbc:mysql:database_name
db.driver=org.mysql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>

            <h2>need more help?</h2>

            <p>
                when your application is run from the play console, you can access directly the current documentation at
                the <a href="/@documentation">/@documentation</a> url or go to <a href="http://www.playframework.org">http://www.playframework.org</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/play-framework">play google group</a> is where play users come to seek help, announce projects, and discuss issues and new features. if you don't have any google account, you can still join the mailing list sending an email to
                <strong>play-framework+subscribe@googlegroups.com</strong>.
            </p>

        <article>

            <h1>welcome to play 2.0</h1>

            <p>
                congratulations, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    your are using play 2.0.2
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>why do you see this page?</h2>

            <p>
                the <code>conf/routes</code> file defines a route that tells play to invoke the <code>application.index</code> action whenever a browser requests the / uri using the get method:
            </p>

<pre><code># home page
get     /               controllers.application.index</code></pre>

            <p>
                so play has invoked the <code>controllers.application.index</code> method to obtain the <code>action</code> to execute:
            </p>

<pre><code>def index = action {
  ok(views.html.index("your new application is ready!"))
}</code></pre>

            <p>
                an action is a function that handles the incoming http request, and returns the http result to send back to the web client.
                here we send a <code>200 ok</code> response, using a template to fill it's content.
            </p>

            <p>
                the template is defined in the <code>app/views/index.scala.html</code> file and compiled as a scala function.
            </p>

<pre><code>@(message: string)

@main("welcome to play 2.0") {

    @play20.welcome(message)

}</code></pre>

            <p>
                the first line of the template defines the function signature. here it just takes a single <code>string</code> parameter.
                then this template calls another function defined in <code>app/views/main.scala.html</code> which displays the html layout, and another
                function that displays this welcome message. you can freely add any html fragment mixed with scala code in this file.
            </p>

            <h2>is this your first time?</h2>

            <p>
                you can now continue with the <a href="/@documentation/scalatodolist">first tutorial</a>. it will guide thru the basics of creating a play 2.0 application.
            </p>

            <h2>need to set up an ide?</h2>

            <p>
                you can start hacking your application right now using any text editor. your changes will be automatically realoaded at each page refresh,
                including modifications made to scala source files.
            </p>

            <p>
                if you want to set up your application in <strong>eclipse</strong> or any other scala ide, check the
                <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>

            <h2>need to connect to a database?</h2>

            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem),
                by adding these lines to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.default.driver=org.h2.driver
db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"</code></pre>

            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library
                to your application dependencies:
            </p>

<pre><code>val appdependencies = seq(
  "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.18"
)</code></pre>

            <p>
                and then add the corresponding jdbc configuration to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.url=jdbc:mysql:database_name
db.driver=org.mysql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>

            <h2>need more help?</h2>

            <p>
                when your application is run from the play console, you can access directly the current documentation at
                the <a href="/@documentation">/@documentation</a> url or go to <a href="http://www.playframework.org">http://www.playframework.org</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/play-framework">play google group</a> is where play users come to seek help, announce projects, and discuss issues and new features. if you don't have any google account, you can still join the mailing list sending an email to
                <strong>play-framework+subscribe@googlegroups.com</strong>.
            </p>

            <h1>welcome to play 2.0</h1>

            <p>
                congratulations, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    your are using play 2.0.2
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>why do you see this page?</h2>

            <p>
                the <code>conf/routes</code> file defines a route that tells play to invoke the <code>application.index</code> action whenever a browser requests the / uri using the get method:
            </p>

<pre><code># home page
get     /               controllers.application.index</code></pre>

            <p>
                so play has invoked the <code>controllers.application.index</code> method to obtain the <code>action</code> to execute:
            </p>

<pre><code>def index = action {
  ok(views.html.index("your new application is ready!"))
}</code></pre>

            <p>
                an action is a function that handles the incoming http request, and returns the http result to send back to the web client.
                here we send a <code>200 ok</code> response, using a template to fill it's content.
            </p>

            <p>
                the template is defined in the <code>app/views/index.scala.html</code> file and compiled as a scala function.
            </p>

<pre><code>@(message: string)

@main("welcome to play 2.0") {

    @play20.welcome(message)

}</code></pre>

            <p>
                the first line of the template defines the function signature. here it just takes a single <code>string</code> parameter.
                then this template calls another function defined in <code>app/views/main.scala.html</code> which displays the html layout, and another
                function that displays this welcome message. you can freely add any html fragment mixed with scala code in this file.
            </p>

            <h2>is this your first time?</h2>

            <p>
                you can now continue with the <a href="/@documentation/scalatodolist">first tutorial</a>. it will guide thru the basics of creating a play 2.0 application.
            </p>

            <h2>need to set up an ide?</h2>

            <p>
                you can start hacking your application right now using any text editor. your changes will be automatically realoaded at each page refresh,
                including modifications made to scala source files.
            </p>

            <p>
                if you want to set up your application in <strong>eclipse</strong> or any other scala ide, check the
                <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>

            <h2>need to connect to a database?</h2>

            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem),
                by adding these lines to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.default.driver=org.h2.driver
db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"</code></pre>

            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library
                to your application dependencies:
            </p>

<pre><code>val appdependencies = seq(
  "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.18"
)</code></pre>

            <p>
                and then add the corresponding jdbc configuration to the <code>conf/application.conf</code> file:
            </p>

<pre><code>db.url=jdbc:mysql:database_name
db.driver=org.mysql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>

            <h2>need more help?</h2>

            <p>
                when your application is run from the play console, you can access directly the current documentation at
                the <a href="/@documentation">/@documentation</a> url or go to <a href="http://www.playframework.org">http://www.playframework.org</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/play-framework">play google group</a> is where play users come to seek help, announce projects, and discuss issues and new features. if you don't have any google account, you can still join the mailing list sending an email to
                <strong>play-framework+subscribe@googlegroups.com</strong>.

            <h1>your new application is ready!</h1>
            <p>
                congratulation, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>
            <h2><a name="why">why do you see this page?</a></h2>
            <p>
                the <strong>conf/routes</strong> file defines a route that tell play to invoke the <strong>application.index</strong> action
                when a browser requests the <strong>/</strong> uri using the <strong>get</strong> method:
            </p>
            <pre><code># application home page
get     /         application.index</code></pre>
            <p>
                so play has invoked the <strong>controllers&#46;application&#46;index()</strong> method:
            </p>
            <pre><code>public static void index() {
    render();
}</code></pre>
            <p>
                using the <strong>render()</strong> call, this action asks play to display a template. by convention play has
                displayed the <strong>app/views/application/index.html</strong> template:
            </p>
            <pre><code>&#35;{extends 'main.html' /}
&#35;{set title:'home' /}

&#35;{welcome /}</code></pre>
            <p>
                this template extends the <strong>app/views/main.html</strong>, and uses the <strong>&#35;{welcome /}</strong> tag to display this
                welcome page.
            </p>
            <h2><a name="ide">need to set up a java ide?</a></h2>
            <p>
                you can start right now to hack your application using any text editor. any changes will be automatically realoaded at the
                next page refresh, including modifications made to java sources files.
            </p>
            <p>
                if you want to set up your application in <strong>eclipse</strong>, <strong>netbeans</strong> or any other java ide, check
                the <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>
            <h2><a name="db">need to connect to a database?</a></h2>
            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem), by adding one of these
                lines to the <strong>conf/application.conf</strong> file:
            </p>
<pre><code># for a transient in memory database (h2 in memory)
db=mem

# for a simple file written database (h2 file stored)
db=fs</code></pre>
            <p>
                if you want to connect to an existing <strong>mysql5 server</strong>, use:
            </p>
<pre><code>db=mysql:user:pwd@database_name</code></pre>
            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library to the
                <strong>lib/</strong> directory of your application, and add these lines to the <strong>conf/application.conf</strong> file:
            </p>
            <pre><code>db.url=jdbc:postgresql:database_name
db.driver=org.postgresql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>
            <h2><a name="doc">need more help?</a></h2>
            <p>
                when your application run in <strong>dev</strong> mode, you can access directly the current documentation at the
                <a href="/@documentation">/@documentation</a> url or go to <a href="http://www.playframework.org">http://www.playframework.org</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/play-framework">play google group</a> is where play users come to seek help, announce projects, and discuss.
                if you don't have any google account, you can still join the mailing list sending an email to

            <h1>your new application is ready!</h1>
            <p>
                congratulation, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>
            <h2><a name="why">why do you see this page?</a></h2>
            <p>
                the <strong>conf/routes</strong> file defines a route that tell play to invoke the <strong>application.index</strong> action
                when a browser requests the <strong>/</strong> uri using the <strong>get</strong> method:
            </p>
            <pre><code># application home page
get     /         application.index</code></pre>
            <p>
                so play has invoked the <strong>controllers&#46;application&#46;index()</strong> method:
            </p>
            <pre><code>public static void index() {
    render();
}</code></pre>
            <p>
                using the <strong>render()</strong> call, this action asks play to display a template. by convention play has
                displayed the <strong>app/views/application/index.html</strong> template:
            </p>
            <pre><code>&#35;{extends 'main.html' /}
&#35;{set title:'home' /}

&#35;{welcome /}</code></pre>
            <p>
                this template extends the <strong>app/views/main.html</strong>, and uses the <strong>&#35;{welcome /}</strong> tag to display this
                welcome page.
            </p>
            <h2><a name="ide">need to set up a java ide?</a></h2>
            <p>
                you can start right now to hack your application using any text editor. any changes will be automatically realoaded at the
                next page refresh, including modifications made to java sources files.
            </p>
            <p>
                if you want to set up your application in <strong>eclipse</strong>, <strong>netbeans</strong> or any other java ide, check
                the <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>
            <h2><a name="db">need to connect to a database?</a></h2>
            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem), by adding one of these
                lines to the <strong>conf/application.conf</strong> file:
            </p>
<pre><code># for a transient in memory database (h2 in memory)
db=mem

# for a simple file written database (h2 file stored)
db=fs</code></pre>
            <p>
                if you want to connect to an existing <strong>mysql5 server</strong>, use:
            </p>
<pre><code>db=mysql:user:pwd@database_name</code></pre>
            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library to the
                <strong>lib/</strong> directory of your application, and add these lines to the <strong>conf/application.conf</strong> file:
            </p>
            <pre><code>db.url=jdbc:postgresql:database_name
db.driver=org.postgresql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>
            <h2><a name="doc">need more help?</a></h2>
            <p>
                when your application run in <strong>dev</strong> mode, you can access directly the current documentation at the
                <a href="/@documentation">/@documentation</a> url or go to <a href="http://www.playframework.org">http://www.playframework.org</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/play-framework">play google group</a> is where play users come to seek help, announce projects, and discuss.
                if you don't have any google account, you can still join the mailing list sending an email to
                <br/><strong>play-framework+subscribe@googlegroups.com</strong>.

            <h1>your new application is ready!</h1>
            <p>
                congratulation, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>
            <h2><a name="why">why do you see this page?</a></h2>
            <p>
                the <strong>conf/routes</strong> file defines a route that tell play to invoke the <strong>application.index</strong> action
                when a browser requests the <strong>/</strong> uri using the <strong>get</strong> method:
            </p>
            <pre><code># application home page
get     /         application.index</code></pre>
            <p>
                so play has invoked the <strong>controllers&#46;application&#46;index()</strong> method:
            </p>
            <pre><code>public static void index() {
    render();
}</code></pre>
            <p>
                using the <strong>render()</strong> call, this action asks play to display a template. by convention play has
                displayed the <strong>app/views/application/index.html</strong> template:
            </p>
            <pre><code>&#35;{extends 'main.html' /}
&#35;{set title:'home' /}

&#35;{welcome /}</code></pre>
            <p>
                this template extends the <strong>app/views/main.html</strong>, and uses the <strong>&#35;{welcome /}</strong> tag to display this
                welcome page.
            </p>
            <h2><a name="ide">need to set up a java ide?</a></h2>
            <p>
                you can start right now to hack your application using any text editor. any changes will be automatically realoaded at the
                next page refresh, including modifications made to java sources files.
            </p>
            <p>
                if you want to set up your application in <strong>eclipse</strong>, <strong>netbeans</strong> or any other java ide, check
                the <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>
            <h2><a name="db">need to connect to a database?</a></h2>
            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem), by adding one of these
                lines to the <strong>conf/application.conf</strong> file:
            </p>
<pre><code># for a transient in memory database (h2 in memory)
db=mem

# for a simple file written database (h2 file stored)
db=fs</code></pre>
            <p>
                if you want to connect to an existing <strong>mysql5 server</strong>, use:
            </p>
<pre><code>db=mysql:user:pwd@database_name</code></pre>
            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library to the
                <strong>lib/</strong> directory of your application, and add these lines to the <strong>conf/application.conf</strong> file:
            </p>
            <pre><code>db.url=jdbc:postgresql:database_name
db.driver=org.postgresql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>
            <h2><a name="doc">need more help?</a></h2>
            <p>
                when your application run in <strong>dev</strong> mode, you can access directly the current documentation at the
                <a href="/@documentation">/@documentation</a> url or go to <a href="http://www.playframework.org">http://www.playframework.org</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/play-framework">play google group</a> is where play users come to seek help, announce projects, and discuss.
                if you don't have any google account, you can still join the mailing list sending an email to
                <br/><strong>play-framework+subscribe@googlegroups.com</strong>.

            <h1>your new application is ready!</h1>
            <p>
                congratulation, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>
            <h2><a name="why">why do you see this page?</a></h2>
            <p>
                the <strong>conf/routes</strong> file defines a route that tell play to invoke the <strong>application.index</strong> action
                when a browser requests the <strong>/</strong> uri using the <strong>get</strong> method:
            </p>
            <pre><code># application home page
get     /         application.index</code></pre>
            <p>
                so play has invoked the <strong>controllers&#46;application&#46;index()</strong> method:
            </p>
            <pre><code>public static void index() {
    render();
}</code></pre>
            <p>
                using the <strong>render()</strong> call, this action asks play to display a template. by convention play has
                displayed the <strong>app/views/application/index.html</strong> template:
            </p>
            <pre><code>&#35;{extends 'main.html' /}
&#35;{set title:'home' /}

&#35;{welcome /}</code></pre>
            <p>
                this template extends the <strong>app/views/main.html</strong>, and uses the <strong>&#35;{welcome /}</strong> tag to display this
                welcome page.
            </p>
            <h2><a name="ide">need to set up a java ide?</a></h2>
            <p>
                you can start right now to hack your application using any text editor. any changes will be automatically realoaded at the
                next page refresh, including modifications made to java sources files.
            </p>
            <p>
                if you want to set up your application in <strong>eclipse</strong>, <strong>netbeans</strong> or any other java ide, check
                the <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>
            <h2><a name="db">need to connect to a database?</a></h2>
            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem), by adding one of these
                lines to the <strong>conf/application.conf</strong> file:
            </p>
<pre><code># for a transient in memory database (h2 in memory)
db=mem

# for a simple file written database (h2 file stored)
db=fs</code></pre>
            <p>
                if you want to connect to an existing <strong>mysql5 server</strong>, use:
            </p>
<pre><code>db=mysql:user:pwd@database_name</code></pre>
            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library to the
                <strong>lib/</strong> directory of your application, and add these lines to the <strong>conf/application.conf</strong> file:
            </p>
            <pre><code>db.url=jdbc:postgresql:database_name
db.driver=org.postgresql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>
            <h2><a name="doc">need more help?</a></h2>
            <p>
                when your application run in <strong>dev</strong> mode, you can access directly the current documentation at the
                <a href="/@documentation">/@documentation</a> url or go to <a href="http://www.playframework.org">http://www.playframework.org</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/play-framework">play google group</a> is where play users come to seek help, announce projects, and discuss.
                if you don't have any google account, you can still join the mailing list sending an email to
                <br/><strong>play-framework+subscribe@googlegroups.com</strong>.

            </p>
            <pre><code># application home page
get     /         application.index</code></pre>
            <p>
                so play has invoked the <strong>controllers&#46;application&#46;index()</strong> method:
            </p>
            <pre><code>public static void index() {
    render();
}</code></pre>
            <p>
                using the <strong>render()</strong> call, this action asks play to display a template. by convention play has
                displayed the <strong>app/views/application/index.html</strong> template:
            </p>
            <pre><code>&#35;{extends 'main.html' /}
&#35;{set title:'home' /}

&#35;{welcome /}</code></pre>
            <p>
                this template extends the <strong>app/views/main.html</strong>, and uses the <strong>&#35;{welcome /}</strong> tag to display this
                welcome page.
            </p>
            <h2><a name="ide">need to set up a java ide?</a></h2>
            <p>
                you can start right now to hack your application using any text editor. any changes will be automatically realoaded at the
                next page refresh, including modifications made to java sources files.
            </p>
            <p>
                if you want to set up your application in <strong>eclipse</strong>, <strong>netbeans</strong> or any other java ide, check
                the <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.

            <h2><a name="db">need to connect to a database?</a></h2>
            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem), by adding one of these
                lines to the <strong>conf/application.conf</strong> file:
            </p>
<pre><code># for a transient in memory database (h2 in memory)
db=mem

# for a simple file written database (h2 file stored)
db=fs</code></pre>
            <p>
                if you want to connect to an existing <strong>mysql5 server</strong>, use:
            </p>
<pre><code>db=mysql:user:pwd@database_name</code></pre>
            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library to the
                <strong>lib/</strong> directory of your application, and add these lines to the <strong>conf/application.conf</strong> file:
            </p>
            <pre><code>db.url=jdbc:postgresql:database_name
db.driver=org.postgresql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>
            <h2><a name="doc">need more help?</a></h2>
            <p>

            <h1>your new application is ready!</h1>
            <p>
                congratulation, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>
            <h2><a name="why">why do you see this page?</a></h2>
            <p>
                the <strong>conf/routes</strong> file defines a route that tell play to invoke the <strong>application.index</strong> action
                when a browser requests the <strong>/</strong> uri using the <strong>get</strong> method:
            </p>
            <pre><code># application home page
get     /         application.index</code></pre>
            <p>
                so play has invoked the <strong>controllers&#46;application&#46;index()</strong> method:
            </p>
            <pre><code>public static void index() {
    render();
}</code></pre>
            <p>
                using the <strong>render()</strong> call, this action asks play to display a template. by convention play has
                displayed the <strong>app/views/application/index.html</strong> template:
            </p>
            <pre><code>&#35;{extends 'main.html' /}
&#35;{set title:'home' /}

&#35;{welcome /}</code></pre>
            <p>
                this template extends the <strong>app/views/main.html</strong>, and uses the <strong>&#35;{welcome /}</strong> tag to display this
                welcome page.
            </p>
            <h2><a name="ide">need to set up a java ide?</a></h2>
            <p>
                you can start right now to hack your application using any text editor. any changes will be automatically realoaded at the
                next page refresh, including modifications made to java sources files.
            </p>
            <p>
                if you want to set up your application in <strong>eclipse</strong>, <strong>netbeans</strong> or any other java ide, check
                the <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>
            <h2><a name="db">need to connect to a database?</a></h2>
            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem), by adding one of these
                lines to the <strong>conf/application.conf</strong> file:
            </p>
<pre><code># for a transient in memory database (h2 in memory)
db=mem

# for a simple file written database (h2 file stored)
db=fs</code></pre>
            <p>
                if you want to connect to an existing <strong>mysql5 server</strong>, use:
            </p>
<pre><code>db=mysql:user:pwd@database_name</code></pre>
            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library to the
                <strong>lib/</strong> directory of your application, and add these lines to the <strong>conf/application.conf</strong> file:
            </p>
            <pre><code>db.url=jdbc:postgresql:database_name
db.driver=org.postgresql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>
            <h2><a name="doc">need more help?</a></h2>
            <p>
                when your application run in <strong>dev</strong> mode, you can access directly the current documentation at the
                <a href="/@documentation">/@documentation</a> url or go to <a href="http://www.playframework.org">http://www.playframework.org</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/play-framework">play google group</a> is where play users come to seek help, announce projects, and discuss.
                if you don't have any google account, you can still join the mailing list sending an email to

            <h1>your new application is ready!</h1>
            <p>
                congratulation, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>
            <h2><a name="why">why do you see this page?</a></h2>
            <p>
                the <strong>conf/routes</strong> file defines a route that tell play to invoke the <strong>application.index</strong> action
                when a browser requests the <strong>/</strong> uri using the <strong>get</strong> method:
            </p>
            <pre><code># application home page
get     /         application.index</code></pre>
            <p>
                so play has invoked the <strong>controllers&#46;application&#46;index()</strong> method:
            </p>
            <pre><code>public static void index() {
    render();
}</code></pre>
            <p>
                using the <strong>render()</strong> call, this action asks play to display a template. by convention play has
                displayed the <strong>app/views/application/index.html</strong> template:
            </p>
            <pre><code>&#35;{extends 'main.html' /}
&#35;{set title:'home' /}

&#35;{welcome /}</code></pre>
            <p>
                this template extends the <strong>app/views/main.html</strong>, and uses the <strong>&#35;{welcome /}</strong> tag to display this
                welcome page.
            </p>
            <h2><a name="ide">need to set up a java ide?</a></h2>
            <p>
                you can start right now to hack your application using any text editor. any changes will be automatically realoaded at the
                next page refresh, including modifications made to java sources files.
            </p>
            <p>
                if you want to set up your application in <strong>eclipse</strong>, <strong>netbeans</strong> or any other java ide, check
                the <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>
            <h2><a name="db">need to connect to a database?</a></h2>
            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem), by adding one of these
                lines to the <strong>conf/application.conf</strong> file:
            </p>
<pre><code># for a transient in memory database (h2 in memory)
db=mem

# for a simple file written database (h2 file stored)
db=fs</code></pre>
            <p>
                if you want to connect to an existing <strong>mysql5 server</strong>, use:
            </p>
<pre><code>db=mysql:user:pwd@database_name</code></pre>
            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library to the
                <strong>lib/</strong> directory of your application, and add these lines to the <strong>conf/application.conf</strong> file:
            </p>
            <pre><code>db.url=jdbc:postgresql:database_name
db.driver=org.postgresql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>
            <h2><a name="doc">need more help?</a></h2>
            <p>
                when your application run in <strong>dev</strong> mode, you can access directly the current documentation at the
                <a href="/@documentation">/@documentation</a> url or go to <a href="http://www.playframework.org">http://www.playframework.org</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/play-framework">play google group</a> is where play users come to seek help, announce projects, and discuss.
                if you don't have any google account, you can still join the mailing list sending an email to
                <br/><strong>play-framework+subscribe@googlegroups.com</strong>.

            <h1>your new application is ready!</h1>
            <p>
                congratulation, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>
            <h2><a name="why">why do you see this page?</a></h2>
            <p>
                the <strong>conf/routes</strong> file defines a route that tell play to invoke the <strong>application.index</strong> action
                when a browser requests the <strong>/</strong> uri using the <strong>get</strong> method:
            </p>
            <pre><code># application home page
get     /         application.index</code></pre>
            <p>
                so play has invoked the <strong>controllers&#46;application&#46;index()</strong> method:
            </p>
            <pre><code>public static void index() {
    render();
}</code></pre>
            <p>
                using the <strong>render()</strong> call, this action asks play to display a template. by convention play has
                displayed the <strong>app/views/application/index.html</strong> template:
            </p>
            <pre><code>&#35;{extends 'main.html' /}
&#35;{set title:'home' /}

&#35;{welcome /}</code></pre>
            <p>
                this template extends the <strong>app/views/main.html</strong>, and uses the <strong>&#35;{welcome /}</strong> tag to display this
                welcome page.
            </p>
            <h2><a name="ide">need to set up a java ide?</a></h2>
            <p>
                you can start right now to hack your application using any text editor. any changes will be automatically realoaded at the
                next page refresh, including modifications made to java sources files.
            </p>
            <p>
                if you want to set up your application in <strong>eclipse</strong>, <strong>netbeans</strong> or any other java ide, check
                the <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>
            <h2><a name="db">need to connect to a database?</a></h2>
            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem), by adding one of these
                lines to the <strong>conf/application.conf</strong> file:
            </p>
<pre><code># for a transient in memory database (h2 in memory)
db=mem

# for a simple file written database (h2 file stored)
db=fs</code></pre>
            <p>
                if you want to connect to an existing <strong>mysql5 server</strong>, use:
            </p>
<pre><code>db=mysql:user:pwd@database_name</code></pre>
            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library to the
                <strong>lib/</strong> directory of your application, and add these lines to the <strong>conf/application.conf</strong> file:
            </p>
            <pre><code>db.url=jdbc:postgresql:database_name
db.driver=org.postgresql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>
            <h2><a name="doc">need more help?</a></h2>
            <p>
                when your application run in <strong>dev</strong> mode, you can access directly the current documentation at the
                <a href="/@documentation">/@documentation</a> url or go to <a href="http://www.playframework.org">http://www.playframework.org</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/play-framework">play google group</a> is where play users come to seek help, announce projects, and discuss.
                if you don't have any google account, you can still join the mailing list sending an email to

            <h1>your new application is ready!</h1>
            <p>
                congratulation, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>
            <h2><a name="why">why do you see this page?</a></h2>
            <p>
                the <strong>conf/routes</strong> file defines a route that tell play to invoke the <strong>application.index</strong> action
                when a browser requests the <strong>/</strong> uri using the <strong>get</strong> method:
            </p>
            <pre><code># application home page
get     /         application.index</code></pre>
            <p>
                so play has invoked the <strong>controllers&#46;application&#46;index()</strong> method:
            </p>
            <pre><code>public static void index() {
    render();
}</code></pre>
            <p>
                using the <strong>render()</strong> call, this action asks play to display a template. by convention play has
                displayed the <strong>app/views/application/index.html</strong> template:
            </p>
            <pre><code>&#35;{extends 'main.html' /}
&#35;{set title:'home' /}

&#35;{welcome /}</code></pre>
            <p>
                this template extends the <strong>app/views/main.html</strong>, and uses the <strong>&#35;{welcome /}</strong> tag to display this
                welcome page.
            </p>
            <h2><a name="ide">need to set up a java ide?</a></h2>
            <p>
                you can start right now to hack your application using any text editor. any changes will be automatically realoaded at the
                next page refresh, including modifications made to java sources files.
            </p>
            <p>
                if you want to set up your application in <strong>eclipse</strong>, <strong>netbeans</strong> or any other java ide, check
                the <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>
            <h2><a name="db">need to connect to a database?</a></h2>
            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem), by adding one of these
                lines to the <strong>conf/application.conf</strong> file:
            </p>
<pre><code># for a transient in memory database (h2 in memory)
db=mem

# for a simple file written database (h2 file stored)
db=fs</code></pre>
            <p>
                if you want to connect to an existing <strong>mysql5 server</strong>, use:
            </p>
<pre><code>db=mysql:user:pwd@database_name</code></pre>
            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library to the
                <strong>lib/</strong> directory of your application, and add these lines to the <strong>conf/application.conf</strong> file:
            </p>
            <pre><code>db.url=jdbc:postgresql:database_name
db.driver=org.postgresql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>
            <h2><a name="doc">need more help?</a></h2>
            <p>
                when your application run in <strong>dev</strong> mode, you can access directly the current documentation at the
                <a href="/@documentation">/@documentation</a> url or go to <a href="http://www.playframework.org">http://www.playframework.org</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/play-framework">play google group</a> is where play users come to seek help, announce projects, and discuss.
                if you don't have any google account, you can still join the mailing list sending an email to
                <br/><strong>play-framework+subscribe@googlegroups.com</strong>.

            <p>
                congratulation, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>
            <h2><a name="why">why do you see this page?</a></h2>
            <p>
                the <strong>conf/routes</strong> file defines a route that tell play to invoke the <strong>application.index</strong> action
                when a browser requests the <strong>/</strong> uri using the <strong>get</strong> method:
            </p>
            <pre><code># application home page
get     /         application.index</code></pre>
            <p>
                so play has invoked the <strong>controllers&#46;application&#46;index()</strong> method:
            </p>
            <pre><code>public static void index() {
    render();
}</code></pre>
            <p>
                using the <strong>render()</strong> call, this action asks play to display a template. by convention play has
                displayed the <strong>app/views/application/index.html</strong> template:
            </p>
            <pre><code>&#35;{extends 'main.html' /}
&#35;{set title:'home' /}

&#35;{welcome /}</code></pre>
            <p>
                this template extends the <strong>app/views/main.html</strong>, and uses the <strong>&#35;{welcome /}</strong> tag to display this
                welcome page.
            </p>
            <h2><a name="ide">need to set up a java ide?</a></h2>
            <p>

            <h2><a name="db">need to connect to a database?</a></h2>
            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem), by adding one of these
                lines to the <strong>conf/application.conf</strong> file:
            </p>
<pre><code># for a transient in memory database (h2 in memory)
db=mem

# for a simple file written database (h2 file stored)
db=fs</code></pre>
            <p>
                if you want to connect to an existing <strong>mysql5 server</strong>, use:
            </p>
<pre><code>db=mysql:user:pwd@database_name</code></pre>
            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library to the
                <strong>lib/</strong> directory of your application, and add these lines to the <strong>conf/application.conf</strong> file:
            </p>
            <pre><code>db.url=jdbc:postgresql:database_name
db.driver=org.postgresql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>

            <h1>your new application is ready!</h1>
            <p>
                congratulation, you've just created a new play application. this page will help you in the few next steps.
            </p>
            <h2><a name="why">why do you see this page?</a></h2>
            <p>
                the <strong>conf/routes</strong> file defines a route that tell play to invoke the <strong>application.index</strong> action
                when a browser requests the <strong>/</strong> uri using the <strong>get</strong> method:
            </p>
            <pre><code># application home page
get     /         application.index</code></pre>
            <p>
                so play has invoked the <strong>controllers&#46;application&#46;index()</strong> method:
            </p>
            <pre><code>public static void index() {
    render();
}</code></pre>
            <p>
                using the <strong>render()</strong> call, this action asks play to display a template. by convention play has
                displayed the <strong>app/views/application/index.html</strong> template:
            </p>
            <pre><code>&#35;{extends 'main.html' /}
&#35;{set title:'home' /}

&#35;{welcome /}</code></pre>
            <p>
                this template extends the <strong>app/views/main.html</strong>, and uses the <strong>&#35;{welcome /}</strong> tag to display this
                welcome page.
            </p>
            <h2><a name="ide">need to set up a java ide?</a></h2>
            <p>
                you can start right now to hack your application using any text editor. any changes will be automatically realoaded at the
                next page refresh, including modifications made to java sources files.
            </p>
            <p>
                if you want to set up your application in <strong>eclipse</strong>, <strong>netbeans</strong> or any other java ide, check
                the <a href="/@documentation/ide">setting up your preferred ide</a> page.
            </p>
            <h2><a name="db">need to connect to a database?</a></h2>
            <p>
                you can quickly set up a developement database (either in memory or written to the filesystem), by adding one of these
                lines to the <strong>conf/application.conf</strong> file:
            </p>
<pre><code># for a transient in memory database (h2 in memory)
db=mem

# for a simple file written database (h2 file stored)
db=fs</code></pre>
            <p>
                if you want to connect to an existing <strong>mysql5 server</strong>, use:
            </p>
<pre><code>db=mysql:user:pwd@database_name</code></pre>
            <p>
                if you need to connect to another jdbc compliant database, first add the corresponding driver library to the
                <strong>lib/</strong> directory of your application, and add these lines to the <strong>conf/application.conf</strong> file:
            </p>
            <pre><code>db.url=jdbc:postgresql:database_name
db.driver=org.postgresql.driver
db.user=root
db.pass=secret</code></pre>
            <h2><a name="doc">need more help?</a></h2>
            <p>
                when your application run in <strong>dev</strong> mode, you can access directly the current documentation at the
                <a href="/@documentation">/@documentation</a> url or go to <a href="http://www.playframework.org">http://www.playframework.org</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/play-framework">play google group</a> is where play users come to seek help, announce projects, and discuss.
                if you don't have any google account, you can still join the mailing list sending an email to
                <br/><strong>play-framework+subscribe@googlegroups.com</strong>.
